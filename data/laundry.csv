0	3.4	L	3.0				1	LITRE	[Washing Liquid Original, Ariel washing liquid with pre treat cap gives you outstanding stain removal in the first wash. The pre treat cap, with its flexible fins and spreading surface allows you to pre treat, scrub, remove stains and also to dose the detergent precisely. Although Ariel is tough on stains, it is very gentle on clothes. Unlike washing powder, Ariel washing liquid gets to work right at the heart of the wash, for perfectly clean laundry pour some liquid on a stain, spread and scrub with the pre treat cap, and put your clothes in your washing machine. For best results, insert the cap filled with the detergent into the washing machine drum. For an extra boost of freshness and softness, use together with Lenor fabric conditioners and Unstoppables. 60 washes based on 50ml per wash.]	http://img.tesco.com/Groceries/pi/727/4084500812727/IDShot_90x90.jpg	Ariel Bio.
