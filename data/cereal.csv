Kellogg   believed in helping all people to flourish and thrive, and that's why we are committed to donating food and money, to families in need through breakfast clubs, foodbanks, and community projects., Sadly, one in seven children goes to school without breakfast in the UK and Ireland**, and a fifth of teachers have seen an increase in hunger in the classroom***. But there is a way to help tackle child hunger in the morning and that's school breakfast clubs., Kellogg's has been supporting breakfast clubs for the last 17 years in the UK and Ireland. In the last year alone we've supported 1,000 school and community breakfast clubs in the UK and Ireland with food, money and training., Head teacher Gill Harding said: ""The funding and cereal we have received from Kellogg's has been such a big help to our school. It has enabled us to buy equipment for our club like bowls and cutlery as well as provide free breakfasts to the children that need it."", Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and by enabling families in need to have breakfast, we are helping them to start their day the best way and help reach their potential throughout the day., If you would like to read more about how we are helping, please visit www.kelloggs.co.uk and www.kelloggs.ie, **UK: Hoyland et al (2012) Nutr Bull, 37 (3), 232 40.
