# Probabilities in the data analytic conversion of social order

# A. Introduction  includes a,b,c from above

This paper is a philosophical reconstruction [@Dewey_2017] of an online grocery ordering system undergoing an upgrade. The reconstruction is empirical in certain respects. It departs from an ethnographic moment: being a member of the audience at an industry/academic conference where a data scientist was describing how recommendations were created for online grocery orders. Starting from this highly mediated and fragmentary encounter with a recommender system and one of its designers, the paper explores the problem the system addresses.  It draws on anthropological and sociological research concerning shopping and list-making to situate the recommender system amongst the social ordering practices of shopping and shopping lists. It makes use of archaeological approaches, in the sense developed by Michel Foucault [@Foucault_1972] in order to identify and map important functional statements and practices configuring the knowledge and order generated by such systems over time. It conducts several code-based experiments in order to reconstruct, using widely available code resources resources such as API (Application Programmer Interfaces) and software libraries for machine learning, some prototypical elements of the system in question.  In doing this, it draws  on the philosophy of science and media theory to frame an engagement with data, algorithms and recommendations around probabilities and their worldly enactments.

Like some recent work in science and technology studies,  anthropology and media studies [@Marres_2017; @Marcus_2014; @Bogost_2012], through this combination of approaches,  the paper allows its own reconstruction to be provisionally shaped by an experiential encounter with the object it describes. At times, this mode of empirical philosophical engagement with its objects may well seem overly concerned with the technical minutiae of the grocery ordering system, and lacking in  sociological rigour or empirical evidence. With some forbearance on the part of readers, however, the main philosophical argument of the paper should resonate sociologically. It concerns social order, or the consistency and regularity of relating and acting amid a world in where probabilities and calculations based on probabilities play a more pervasive role.

The main argument of the paper concerns how  probability operates in Big Data situations. While calculations of probability have  long-standing importance in many settings (insurance, medicine, experimental and field sciences, operations research, risk analysis, engineering design, public health,  economic modelling, etc.), probabilities have taken on a much thicker situational texture. In recent research and opinion on  data practice, personalization has been seen as the linchpin of predictive modelling. The reconstruction of the recommender system suggests a different way of seeing these transformations.   Operational probabilities differ from epistemic probabilities in their position in the world, as part of infrastructures, transactions, and event-structures. Taking their complex siting into account, and accepting their _physical_ reality, we might come to understand the world operative probabilities belong to as what the philosopher of science Karl Popper understood as a 'world of propensities, as an unfolding process of realizing possibilities and of unfolding new possibilities' [@Popper_1990,19]. Given this understanding of operational probability, our understanding of what is enacted in contemporary data analytics, especially in association with platforms [@Gillespie_2010] where the operationality of probabilities are heightened,  might shift. 

The broad implication of the argument concerns how we think about social order or regularities amidst change or transformation. Proponents and critics of Big Data present the advent of large volumes of data and analytical techniques (machine learning in particular) as transforming for better or worse organisations, institutions, economic processes and social life. Personalization has been a pivotal element, they argue, of this transformation.  I suggest too that a transformation or conversion event is occurring, but one which might also, even in the midst of much ongoing personalization,  open up the possibility of experiencing the world differently, and conceiving of social ordering processes somewhat afresh. Even if the argument is centred on shopping, the analysis of how a world of propensities continuously and unevenly converts into realizations applies across the board, from the most physical to the most ideal or abstract settings. The average everydayness of the example here -- grocery shopping -- allows some first hand engagement with the messiness, the entanglements, and potentials of this conversion event in ways that other interesting settings -- particle physics for instance -- do not.

# B. Patel section + opening description

At one of the many industry-meets-academia events occurring in increasingly data science-oriented higher education institutions in the UK, speakers from industry, government and commerce described their work with predictive models.[^11.1] Shreena Patel, a PhD graduate in statistics and operations research,  works as a data scientist for DunnHumby, a well-known [ customer science company ](https://www.dunnhumby.com/) [@dunnhumby_2017].  Her work at DunnHumby focuses on online grocery shopping at the supermarket chain Tesco.  Speaking to an audience of statisticians and operations researchers, Patel focused on the development and operation of predictive models underlying  shopping list recommendations. Her presentation was filled with graphs, numbers, and tables concerning ongoing development of the 'Have you forgotten?' recommender system. 

[^11.1]: More than 100  Data Science Institutes have been set up in North America, Europe and UK since around 2012. The traffic between higher education and data analytics in industry is intense and flows in several forms: people funding, research findings, software and technical devices (code) and training. 

Against the background of the sheer number of commodities and their distribution of prices,  Patel's presentation presents two opportunities. First, by recounting, contextualising and commenting on the main steps in making the 'Have your forgotten?' list, we might follow some of the predictive sense-making done by data scientists and customer analytics teams working with transactional data in a typical commercial setting. Patel mentioned many of these steps only fleetingly in the presentation, for they are largely taken for granted as part of predictive analytic practice. Second, Patel focused on the renovation and updating of long-standing data-mining practice via a much more explicitly 'big data' and 'machine learning' oriented implementation. Her presentation concerns what we might term, for reasons that will gradually emerge, a 'conversion event' in which a long-standing recommender system was replaced by a new, explicitly 'big data'-style system concerned with 'personally relevant' recommendations.   What stands out from the presentation is the normality of the recommender system: it is part of a long-standing and ongoing transformation or conversion of grocery shopping. From a sociological standpoint, the interest lies less in specific technical innovations and more on how the ordering work done by recommender systems relates to problems of social order more generally. 

Online grocery shopping at [Tesco](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/?icid=dchp_groceriesshopgroceries), the largest supermarket chain in the UK, includes recommendations for further grocery purchases under the title of 'Have you forgotten?'. When Tesco customers shop for groceries online, a list of five recommendations appear at the checkout stage. The recommendations are the product of a recommender system, an important category of operational device in big data (see for instance [@Striphas_2015] for analysis of Netflix recommendation; [@Morris_2015]  or [@Seaver_2015] for an account of music recommendations).  The question 'have you forgotten?' is followed by a list of some  grocery items that could have been or are usually on a shopping list. The title of the suggestions is a bit misleading: the recommender system, as we will see, is not concerned with forgetting, with the many slips and oversights associated to which shopping is prone,  but rather with items that customers had not selected perhaps because they had never thought of buying them in the first place.

[TBA: THIS PARA could be moved down] The shelves of large contemporary supermarket are the endpoint of global logistic supply chains, in all their logistical, value-transforming and brand-mediated hypercomplexity (see [@Neilson_2012; @Tsing_2009]).  Groceries imply a planetary geography of agriculture, industry, transport, communication and financialisation animated by flows of labour and capital. Encounters between this hyper-complex commodity-geography and people, even in the familiar confines of a supermarket, are no simple matter, either for shoppers or for supermarket operators such as Tesco.

# C. Shopping  lists and  a theory of social ordering 

The anthropologist  Daniel Miller has argued [@Miller_2012] that  shopping takes place as a negotiation of discrepancies between normative and actual social order (for instance, between ideals of health and commitments to thrift). What Miller suggests here is that ... [TBA]  It can also be seen  as a sacrificial ritual that re-instates social order in various ways. 

From an ethnomethodological standpoint, shopping lists provide important clues to how local social order is constituted, maintained, and repaired. Social ordering is done in shopping, and the shopping list as an inscriptive device stabilises certain forms of ordering at the expense of other possible orderings.  

The shopping list, whether written on the back of an envelope, or saved as a list in an online grocery shopping system, lies at the intersection of logistical flows, infrastructural orderings, and  lively negotiations around actual and normative social orders.  Shopping lists, therefore  are intersectional ordering devices that encapsulates a universe of possible references, and a teeming multitude of propensities with an actual local order (in both senses of that term: an ordering and an imperative). As people shop, either by  trawling along aisles packed with thousands of products, or scrolling down screens or searching for particular brands amidst search results, lists inscribe some kind of order that filters or reduces the excessive propensities, claims, dazzle and distraction of commodities to the practicalities of domestic economy.

Hand-written shopping lists undoubtedly have ongoing importance and display interestingly mixed ordering practices (see the montage of handwritten shopping lists at [Grocery List](http://www.grocerylist.org)). But online shopping lists take shape at the intersection of web and internet infrastructures, supply chain logistics, individualised practices and *habitus,* and increasingly, the predictive operations of  recommender systems. Just as the aisles and shelves of a supermarket present a densely-woven semiotics of objects competing for visual attention by offering distinctions of taste, thrift, expedience, novelty, indulgence, health and increasingly, online shopping recommender systems generate lists that seek to align people to commodities that they otherwise might have little relation to (see [@Turow_2015] for an overview).  

If, as the social anthropologist Jack Goody argues, lists are historically primary as forms of writing in urbanizing cultures [@Goody_1986], and if list-making and its later variants (e.g. tables) precede discursive and narrative writing practices, then we might expect lists to function as powerful social ordering devices. More recent sociological work on lists (see [@deGoede_2016] for an overview) explore the social and political potency of lists as ordering devices. As literary scholars suggest (see [@Mainberger_2003]), even if lists have often been de-valued as literary forms, list-making commonly appears in literary form whenever writing seeks to address, name, group or evoke totality, profusion, excess or abundance. From both  anthropological and literary perspectives, shopping lists have excellent reasons to exist: they are deeply rooted in organisational life and infrastructures. Lists weave together people, infrastructures, things, and places.[^1.456]    

[^1.456]: While lists intersect strongly with other meaning and sense-making practices in everyday life and popular culture, they can be refractory to discourse  and textual analysis methods built around models of language or speech, with its rules of syntax and grammar. On the one hand, lists are highly associative. They can be interpreted or decoded semiotically, although they exhibit  variations in textuality -- how they are written and read -- that thwart semiotic readings. On the other hand, as operational inscriptions, they can be treated ethnomethodologically, as the production of social order in a given setting. We might, in the light of their mutability, permeability and embedding in social order,  approach lists from various theoretical angles -- as asignifying semiotics as Maurizio Lazzarato calls it in his _Signs and Machines_ [@Lazzarato_2014] or as elements in 'a new order of spatio-temporal continuity for forms of economic, political and cultural life' as Celia Lury puts it in her account of topological turn [@Lury_2012].

Finally, and more formally, we might also consider some of the formal properties of lists as orderings. All lists imply order, but what kind of order? Mathematicians distinguish lists from sets on the basis of a distinction focused on order. Formally, both lists and sets are collections, but a list also contains a mapping of its elements to an ordering, usually the natural or counting numbers. Sometimes this order is explicit. Numbers are written down one side of the list. Often the order is implicit to the spatial arrangement of the list. This formal idea of the list as a mapping is helpful since it suggests relational possibilities. Mappings occasion relations between sets, collections, group or multiplicities.  Mappings between list order and social order are manifestly highly contingent. A flight checklist differs greatly from a personal to-do list, even if they share many formal properties.  Listing practices in a given social setting, therefore, always index an engagement between the formal properties of the list and the necessarily more fluid dynamics of social order. From the perspective of social order, shopping lists, as they are co-constructed by a supermarket chain's recommender system, might be important intersectional zones for the conversion of average everydayness through data-analytic propensities.

# D. Archaeology of recommendations  from 1984  to 2007

The main narrative of Patel's presentation concerned a shift from a well-established loyalty-card based data-mining model to a predictive, probabilistic, personally relevant re-writing of the shopping list in almost-realtime. The changes Patel described are increasingly widespread and common. While they are configured in Tesco-specific ways by DunnHumby (and this reflects a longer history), they are also broadly typical. Tesco is the largest supermarket chain in UK, famous amongst retailers for its  customer loyalty and targeted marketing programme known as 'Tesco Clubcard,' which started in 1991. DunnHumby -- founded by operations researchers Edwina Dunn and Clive Humby -- is said to have convinced the CEO of Tesco sometime in 1991 that a loyalty card program could change the supermarket chain's relationship to its customers.  Clive Humby's academic publications  are hard to track down, but an early paper given at the _Conference of Young Operational Researchers_ in Nottingham in 1984 suggests the direction that he, DunnHumby and later Tesco would take in constructing lists [@OKeefe_1984]. The abstract for Humby's presentation pre-figures an ongoing trajectory for data mining techniques aimed at eliciting detailed information on individual customer preferences.   

```{r humby-1984, fig.cap = 'Abstract from a Clive Humby presentation (Humby,1984)'}
include_graphics('figure/2_humby_young_org_1994.png')
```

While Tesco  succeeded in data-mining its customers using demographic segmentation,  and perhaps became the UK's biggest supermarket with the help of data-mining in the 1990s, the shopping environment  in 2017 is markedly different [@Turow_2017]. It is no longer organised around campaigns involving special offers or redemption of points for demographically segmented loyal customers (DunnHumby made heavy use of UK Census data). It can no longer rely on placement of goods in carefully chosen locations in stores. It needs or at least might want to continuously up-sell and cross-sell to customers who might hardly ever visits the supermarket itself. 

How could we characterise the shift from ClubCard data mining to online grocery markets?  If 'Tesco is the clear winner in the online grocery market, in fact it takes almost 50p of every £1 spent on food shopping on the internet' [How SEO helps Tesco to dominate the online grocery market](https://econsultancy.com/blog/64841-how-seo-helps-tesco-to-dominate-the-online-grocery-market)[@Silverwood-Cope_2014], then Tesco itself has undergone some kind of conversion? Patel described her work at DunnHumby as shifting the recommender system from a 'rules-based list' to a 'relevancy model.' The relevancy model changed how the 'Have You Forgotten' list was constructed.   This shift is a typical of broader re-organisation of prediction in which existing data analysis practices are being re-distributed and intensified in particular ways. The shift in models results in a more probabilistic structuring of lists.  The ostensible banality of the 'Have you forgotten?' recommendations betrays micrological signs of a topologically complex predictive infrastructure that intervenes in list-based social ordering to reconfigure alignments between people and things. 

This is not a drastic or abrupt event. Academic researchers first began writing about recommender systems in the mid-1990s. From the outset they highlighted a potential shift from demographic-driven market research or data mining techniques to personalized recommendations. For instance, writing in 1997 in a special section of the _Communications of the ACM_ on recommender systems, Paul Resnick and Hal Varian (at that time Dean of Information Sciences at UC Berkeley, but currently Chief Economist at Google), made much of this personalisation [@Resnick_1997]. Resnick and Varian  emphasise the need to distinguish the emerging practices from data mining: 

> In everyday life, we rely on recommendations from other people. ... Recommender systems augment this natural social process. In a typical recommender  system, people provide recommendations as inputs, which the system then aggregates and directs to appropriate recipients. In some cases the primary transformation is in the aggregation; in others the system’s value lies in its ability to make good matches between the recommenders and those seeking recommendations.[@Resnick_1997,56] 

Writing just after the advent of web-based e-Commerce, Resnick and Varian  imagined recommender systems augmenting the 'collaborative filtering' that people do when they write and read reviews of products and services (for instance, on the travel website, TripAdvisor; [@Scott_2012]). In 1997,  Resnick and Varian expected that 'people [would] provide recommendations' and recommender systems would aggregate and rank recommendations for recipients. A slightly later review, [@Schafer_2001], diagrams an augmented 'natural social process' with a range of elements, technologies, inputs and outputs, with varying degrees of personalization. 

# E. Experimenting with probabilistic conversions

This section of the paper returns directly to Patel's presentation, and the character of the newly implemented  recommender system.  In the discussion that follows, the description of components of the new recommender system -- predictive models and their parameters, infrastructural provisioning, product similarity matrices --  and the problems of  recommendation -- too many products, changes over time, unstable propensities of things in their associations with people -- together suggest that personalization, and the 'personal relevance model' have a troubled relation to social order. I develop an analysis centred on probabilities and processes of probabilisation -- rendering situations calculable as probabilities -- in exploring Patel's account of the recommender system. The motivation to focus on probabilities and probabilisation is explicitly philosophically reconstructive. It represents an attempt to reframe the operation of the recommender system in a way freed from lingering incompatibilities between calculation and social life [@Dewey_1957, 26] .           

In order to do this, we need a working notion of probability. I draw directly on the work of Karl Popper for this. In an essay written towards the end of his career, Popper presents an alternative account of probabilities as real processes, in the same way that contemporary sciences might see forces as real [@Popper_1990]. Somewhat counter-intuitively, Popper does not identify probability with either degree of belief (likelihood) or frequency of events. Instead he suggests 'they should be regarded as _inherent in a situation_ ' [@Popper_1990, 14].  On this account, probabilities are tendencies towards realization inherent in a situation. Probabilities have or indeed are _propensities_, tendencies to realize the event (11). While this somewhat abstract philosophical account of probability as propensity might seem to be anchored far away from the concerns of online grocery shopping, Patel's presentation of the personal relevance model and the ways in which it seeks to calculate probabilities of purchase. The series of prototyping reconstructions I am about to discuss will explore the tenability of this rather radical alternative to regular narratives of personalization.[^65.1]

[^65.1]: The media theorist Mark Hansen has recently applied Popper's account to argue  that 'predictive analytics are discoveries of micrological propensities that are not directly correlated with human understanding and affectivity and that do not by themselves cohere into clearly identifiable events' [@Hansen_2015a, 111-112]. Hansen's account differs from many widely shared views of big data. In the face of the so much personalization (and Patel's presentation exemplifies this), Hansen attributes a somewhat impersonalizing force to big data.  If  much predictive practice attempts to elicit 'micrological propensities' from data, Hansen links data to things via probabilities: 'whatever explanatory and causal value predictive analytics of large datasets have is, I suggest, ultimately rooted in this ontological transformation whereby probabilities are understood to be expressions of the actual propensity of things' [@Hansen_2015a, 120]. Hansen theorises big data or predictive analytics as an 'ontological transformation' that deploys probabilities in an evermore closely woven and encompassing expression of animated, eventful, propensities of things. Predictive analytics links probabilities as calculations to propensities or the mutable associative agencies of things. The practical and indeed empirical  question is whether such transformations or 'conversion' in relations between probabilities and 'the propensities of things'  can be detected and articulated in the prosaic setting of shopping lists and recommender systems. 'Conversion' is a preferable term for these changes. Not much hinges on the choice of terms, but 'conversion' happens to be the term used by Patel.  It highlights  re-orientations in subjects, experience, things, numbers and infrastructures that ranges more widely and are more grounded than Hansen's 'ontological transformation' formulation. 

## Apriori as conditional probabilities

Popper suggests that one of the reasons probability has been difficult to work with philosophically, even as it pervades scientific thought, is that a certain limited domain of probability practice focused on dice rolls, coin tosses, urns with balls and other seemingly random events has occupied centre stage in concepts of probability. Even if it has been enormously productive and transformative, it is insufficient because it privileges _absolute_ probability at the expense of _conditional_ probabilities. 'We need,' Popper urges, '_a calculus of relative or conditional probabilities_ as opposed _a calculus of absolute probabilities_' [@Popper_1990, 16]. Relative or conditional probabilities are propensities that depend on other events for their own realization. All events require other events, so all probabilities are conditional, even if probability calculations have typically preferred to determine  the weight of possibilities devoid of the inevitable physical conditioning of their realization.

Viewed from the standpoint of probabilities, many predictive systems are highly crafted arrangements for the calculation of conditional probabilities. For instance, the first element of the new recommender system consisted in a change of the underpinning algorithms and model. Patel described a move from 'a rules-based system'  to  a 'personal relevance model' as the basis of the new recommender system. It is likely that what Patel describes as  the 'rules-based system' refers  to the extremely well-known `apriori` algorithm or association rules learning technique, developed  by computer scientists Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikanti working at IBM Research Alameda in the early 1990s [@Agrawal_1994]. A now-classic approach to 'market basket analysis,' it was listed as one of the top ten data mining algorithms in a survey conducted amongst data miners [@Wu_2008] and usually attracts a chapter in data-mining and machine learning textbooks (e.g. [@Hastie_2009]). The interest of `apriori` for our purposes is that it begins to address the problem of understanding large numbers of shopping transactions as a matter of conditional probability. 

```{r arules-ex, cache=TRUE, fig.cap='Frequency of association betwene items in the `Grocery` dataset', message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE}
library(knitr)
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
library(datasets)
data(Groceries)
itemFrequencyPlot(Groceries,topN=10,col=rainbow(10), ntype="absolute",  cex.axis = 0.55)
```

The notion of conditional probability at work in `aprior` is relatively simple, and assumes that the frequency of transactions provides the best guide to what shoppers are likely to do. The `apriori` algorithm finds sets of items that commonly occur together in transactions. In this sense, is still oriented by a notion of absolute probability, inflected by some elements of conditional probability.   Commonly occurring sets are expressed as 'association rules.' For instance, using the `Groceries` dataset in the `R` package `arules,`  the `apriori` algorithm counts frequencies of purchase in the overall set of all items purchased in a supermarket (the `Groceries` dataset  was acquired from a 'local German supermarket' [@Hahsler_2006a]). Figure \@ref(fig:arules-ex) shows how often the most common items appear. `Whole milk` appears most frequently.

```{r arules-ex2}
options(digits=2)
rules<- apriori(data=Groceries, parameter=list(supp=0.001,conf = 0.15,minlen=2), appearance = list(default="rhs",lhs="whole milk"), control = list(verbose=FALSE))
rules_sorted <- sort(rules, decreasing=TRUE,by="confidence")
kable(inspect(rules_sorted[1:5]), caption='The first five association rules for the `Groceries` dataset')
```

The association rule-based model for the `Groceries` dataset illustrates some characteristic ordering practices of 1990s-style data-mining approaches to lists. The association between items is expressed in the form of _rules_ whose importance is can be ranked by how frequently items are found in the same purchase. Although the `apriori` model does not use the language of probability calculus, the 'rules,' a term derived from older decision support literature, rank associations between items. When we run the `apriori` algorithm on the `Groceries` dataset, the resulting set of rules (shown in Table \@ref(tab:arules-ex2)) indicates that milk and vegetables has a stronger association than milk and buns.  The calculations of `support` (how frequently the association appears in the dataset), `confidence` (how often the rule applies in the dataset)  and   `lift` (a ratio between the `support` and the independent frequencies of the items) in the table attempt to measure the strength of these associations in different ways. 


## 2500 sauces: `Apriori` meets the API 

Even as `apriori`  elicits associations between things, it struggles with the propensity of commodities to multiply. A simple illustration of the combinatorial problem faced by recommender system can be developed by bringing the `Grocery` dataset together with the actual list of items that sells in its online grocery shopping site.  If we take all the items in the `Grocery` dataset and paste them into the 'shopping list' box on the Tesco grocery website (or as I did, run them as searches on the TescoLab Product API [@Tesco_2016]), each of the 169 items in the `Grocery` dataset yields dozens and sometimes thousands of products from Tesco online.

```{r tesco-ex, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.cap ='Tesco surplus',  fig.margin=TRUE}
    library(ggplot2)
    tesco = read.csv('data/reference_data/tesco_groceries.csv')
    total = sum(tesco$actual, na.rm=TRUE) 
    tesco = na.omit(tesco)
    tesco$actual = as.integer(tesco$actual)
    ggplot(tesco[tesco$actual>50,],
        aes(x=labels, y=actual, fill=labels)) +
        geom_bar(stat='identity') + coord_flip() +
        ggtitle('Tesco grocery items with more than 50 products') +
        theme(legend.position="none", axis.text=element_text(size=7))

```

Items in the `Groceries` dataset proliferate into a Tesco's list of branded products. The 169 items of the `Groceries` dataset  expand into roughly `r total` Tesco items (see Figure \@ref(fig:tesco-ex)).  There is, I would suggest, a logistic proliferation that recommender systems encounter. The multiple listed  in the `Grocery` dataset becomes more open in this setting through new impersonal intersections that could find themselves in associations of various strengths.  If we think just of the almost 2500 sauces or 1200 `rice` products supplied by the Tesco API,  then a tremendous number of associations between sauce and rice are possible. The propensities of actual sauce and rice products to find themselves together in an individual purchase vary greatly. The proliferation of things on the shelves of supermarket or grocery warehouse confronts produces a combinatorial problem for data-mining machine learning approaches such as association rules. `r total` products (actually Patel mentioned 200,000 products) can be combined in a vast number of ways. If a typical shopping list has 20 items, then there are `r format(choose(total, 20), 2)` possible lists. Some of this vast number of possible shopping lists have propensities or tendencies to realization that are close to zero. But others with somewhat higher propensities might furnish the basis of interesting recommendations. 

More importantly, the limited conditioning of probability of the association rules approach suggests a compelling reason for personalization.  Even if the association rules and the `apriori` algorithm   generate recommendable sets of frequency-weighted associations, an `apriori`-based recommender system contains no statistical model. Its probabilisation of shopping is incomplete since it only works on associations between things. The tendency of some milk to find itself in a shopping basket alongside bread attests to an important commonality of practice in certain parts of the world. But the conditional probabilities implicit in the model do not bring in much of the world and its teeming sieve of propensities moving towards realization.  These associations are not trivial, but they are very open-ended. Put in terms of the big data conversion, the rules-based system lacks, in principle, a means of crystallizing a limited or enclosed set of possibilities. 

## The list in its mapping to probabilities

Predictive models are central technical elements in many big data arrangements because they provide a way of constructing conditional probabilities that incorporate more of the situation in which any propensity -- to purchase a bottle of Vueve Cliquot champagne for instance -- is inherent. In the new recommender system described by Patel, the business goal is to extend the list of the items customers have selected for purchase with  a few well-chosen items. In order to do this, the list of items selected for purchase will be extended by recommendations that have, according to a predictive model, the most chance of 'conversion'; that is, actual purchase. The predictive model carries the burden of calculating the conditional probability of purchase given everything known about the situation at this moment in time.  

Patel introduced the new 'personal relevance model' with a data graphic familiar to machine learners and statistical modellers. (A sketch of her graph appears in Figure \@ref(fig:models).)  The graph plots the _precision_ -- the proportion of the recommended products that customers actually purchase -- for several different statistical models.  The graph indexes the 'causal efficacy' of the recommender system, its capacity to include and transform propensities or 'real potentialities' into operational events or purchases.  The graph compares the previous rule-based recommender systems with some of the relevancy-model alternatives -- logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting and a few others -- in terms of their predictions and how those predictions turned out. Patel dismissed most of the models quite quickly and focused only on one, the logistic regression model, which did as well or slight other than other alternatives. 


The models Patel so briefly mentioned are all 'classifiers,' predictive models that 'classify' particular outcomes by calculating their probability.  Much of the core architecture of the machine learning classifier models received scant reference in Patel's presentation. It is most likely that in DunnHumby's work, the classifying model at the heart of the recommender system constructs a decision boundary in vector space between points that belong to different classes of things [@Mackenzie_2015e]. The classes of things are binary: `recommended` or `not recommended,` and for many of the models shown in the graph, membership of a thing such as grocery to the binary classes are expressed as a probability.  The logistic regression model generates probabilities for each product for each customer. The crucial point here is that the shopping list written by the customer is extended, quasi-invisibly, in the recommender system to potentially any of the 250,000 items in the Tesco inventory.

[HERE] 

Patel did not articulate the implication of the contrast between the left and right hand side of the graphic. Although the statistical framing appears explicitly (e.g. in measuring the precision of  recommender systems), the underlying shift to a statistical model is barely mentioned.

# F. Conclusion

The 'minute and extensive scrutinizing' [@Dewey_1957] of a recommender system undergoing a conversion from an older data-mining approach to a current 'personal relevance model' approach addresses a specific situation: online grocery shopping (not shopping in general) and the ordering of lists.

The theory of shopping lists constructed at the beginning of the paper was a scaffolding component. It draws on anthropology, sociology and mathematics to suggest that we see shopping lists as the site of a complex negotiation between different social orders. The list itself as an inscriptive device functions as an ordering device, a device that accommodates an immense variety of specific habits, dispositions, values and associations. The mapping component of the list, the order that arranges the set of items according to different interests and aims, is the operational focus of recommender systems.      

The personalization of recommendations has been a defining characteristic of many big data conversion events. Rightly, the effects of all-consuming personalization have been the target of critics and critical research. The archaeology of the Tesco recommender system, including its early experiments with demographic data-mining, its adoption of a rule-based 'market basket' analysis system, and its current implementation of a 'personal relevance model' certainly follows that trajectory.   But the conversion event is not reducible to personalization.

Probabilization precedes personalization. When we observe what is practically done to construct a personal relevance model and apply it to a shopping list, we see, conditional probabilities, predictive models, the importance of data accumulated over time,  platform experiences, the rhythms of infrastructural maintenance, and open-ended construction of new features in data, all of which negotiate shifting and complicated associations between people and things, people and people, and things with things. If social order is made of associations, is to be social is to associate, then the forms of association taking shape in this and other similar conversion events might be understood as understand as operationalizing probability in matrices of propensity. As Popper argues, probabilities are being realized in the same way that fields of force were realized in modern physics. Probabilization does not take place in physics laboratories but on platforms, combining databases, compute capacity, interfaces and global supply chain logistics. 

The fact that probabilisation largely takes the form of personalization tends to obscure the re-framing of social order taking place. This ordering  depends on  the mappings that inscriptive devices such as shopping lists  display. Only because shopping is already somewhat ordered by lists can a partial re-mapping, provisionally conducive to new events, take place. The conversion entailed in this re-mapping is not just about perosnalization. It is more ontological than that since it includes relations running multi-laterally between people and things in time. It is less ontological, however, in that it is not a sudden transformation, but an ongoing process of adjusting, scaffolding, intervening and configuring orders.  

Reconstructions of specific conversion events associated with big data can work in different ways. The combination of social theory, archaeology, philosophy and model/data prototypes used in this paper sketches one possible way of addressing the trouble, the disturbance or instability that seems to affect many discussions of big data.
