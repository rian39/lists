# Probabilities in the data analytic conversion of social order

# A. Introduction  includes a,b,c from above

This paper is a philosophical reconstruction [@Dewey_2017] of an online grocery ordering system. The reconstruction is empirical in certain respects. It departs from an ethnographic moment: being a member of the audience at an industry/academic conference where a data scientist was describing how recommendations were created for online grocery orders. Given this highly mediated and limited encounter with a recommender system and one of its designers, the paper constructs a multi-layered account. It draws on anthropological and sociological research concerning shopping and list-making to situate the recommender system amongst the social ordering practices of shopping. It conducts several code-based experiments in order to reconstruct, using widely available code resources resources such as API (Application Programmer Interfaces) and software libraries for machine learning, some important elements of the system in question.  It makes use of archaeological approaches, in the sense developed by Michel Foucault [@Foucault_1972] in order to identify and map the functional statements and practices underpinning the knowledge and order generated by such systems over time. Not least, I draw on the philosophy of science and media theory to frame an engagement with data, algorithms and recommendations around probabilities and their enactments. Like some recent work in science and technology studies,  anthropology and media studies [@Marres_2017; @Rabinow_2004; @Bogost_2012], through this combination of approaches,  the paper itself provisionally allows its own reconstruction to be shaped by an experiential encounter with the object it describes. At times, this mode of empirical philosophical engagement with its objects may well seem overly concerned with the technical minutiae of the grocery ordering system, and lacking in  sociological rigour or empirical evidence. With some forbearance on the part of readers, however, the main philosophical argument of the paper should resonate sociologically. It concerns social order, or the consistency and regularity of relating and acting amid a world in where probabilities and calculations based on probabilities play a more pervasive role.

The main argument of the paper concerns how  probability operates in Big Data situations. While calculations of probability have  long-standing importance in many settings (insurance, medicine, experimental and field sciences, operations research, risk analysis, engineering design, public health,  economic modelling, etc.), probabilities have taken on a much thicker situational texture. Operational probabilities differ from epistemic probabilities in their position in the world, as part of infrastructures, transactions, and event-structures. Taking their complex siting into account, and accepting their _physical_ reality, we might come to understand the world they belong to as what the philosopher of science Karl Popper understood as a 'world of propensities, as an unfolding process of realizing possibilities and of unfolding new possibilities' [@Popper_1990,19]. Given this understanding of operational probability, our understanding of what is enacted in contemporary data analytics, especially in association with platforms [@Gillespie_2010] might shift. 

The broad implication of the argument concerns how we think about social order or regularities: proponents and critics of Big Data present the advent of large volumes of data and analytical techniques (machine learning in particular) as transforming organisations, institutions, economic processes and social life. I suggest too that a transformation or conversion event is occurring, but one which might open up the possibility of experiencing the world differently, and conceiving of social ordering processes somewhat afresh.  Even if the argument is centred on an eminently social practice such as shopping, the analysis of how a world of propensities continuously and unevenly converts into realizations applies across the board, from the most physical to the most ideal or abstract settings. The average everydayness of the example here -- grocery shopping -- allows some first hand engagement with the messiness, the entanglements, and potentials of this conversion event in ways that other interesting settings -- particle physics for instance -- do not.

# B. Patel section + opening description

At one of the many industry-meets-academia events occurring in increasingly data science-oriented higher education institutions in the UK, speakers from industry, government and commerce described their work with predictive models.[^11.1] Shreena Patel, a PhD graduate in statistics and operations research,  works as a data scientist for DunnHumby, a well-known [ customer science company ](https://www.dunnhumby.com/) [@dunnhumby_2017].  Her work at DunnHumby focuses on online grocery shopping at the supermarket chain Tesco.  Speaking to an audience of statisticians and operations researchers, Patel focused on the development and operation of predictive models underlying  shopping list recommendations. Her presentation was filled with graphs, numbers, and tables concerning ongoing development of the 'Have you forgotten?' recommender system. 

[^11.1]: More than 100  Data Science Institutes have been set up in North America, Europe and UK since around 2012. The traffic between higher education and data analytics in industry is intense and flows in several forms: people funding, research findings, software and technical devices (code) and training. 

Against the background of the sheer number of commodities and their distribution of prices,  Patel's presentation presents two opportunities. First, by recounting, contextualising and commenting on the main steps in making the 'Have your forgotten?' list, we might follow some of the predictive sense-making done by data scientists and customer analytics teams working with transactional data in a typical commercial setting. Patel mentioned many of these steps only fleetingly in the presentation, for they are largely taken for granted as part of predictive analytic practice. Second, Patel focused on the renovation and updating of long-standing data-mining practice via a much more explicitly 'big data' and 'machine learning' oriented implementation. Her presentation concerns what we might term, for reasons that will gradually emerge, a 'conversion event' in which a long-standing recommender system was replaced by a new, explicitly 'big data'-style system concerned with 'personally relevant' recommendations.   What stands out from the presentation is the normality of the recommender system: it is part of a long-standing and ongoing transformation or conversion of grocery shopping. From a sociological standpoint, the interest lies less in specific technical innovations and more on how the ordering work done by recommender systems relates to problems of social order more generally. 

Online grocery shopping at [Tesco](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/?icid=dchp_groceriesshopgroceries), the largest supermarket chain in the UK, includes recommendations for further grocery purchases under the title of 'Have you forgotten?'. When Tesco customers shop for groceries online, a list of five recommendations appear at the checkout stage. The recommendations are the product of a recommender system, an important category of operational device in big data (see for instance [@Striphas_2015] for analysis of Netflix recommendation; [@Morris_2015]  or [@Seaver_2015] for an account of music recommendations).  The question 'have you forgotten?' is followed by a list of some  grocery items that could have been or are usually on a shopping list. The title of the suggestions is a bit misleading: the recommender system, as we will see, is not concerned with forgetting, with the many slips and oversights associated to which shopping is prone,  but rather with items that customers had not selected perhaps because they had never thought of buying them in the first place.

The shelves of large contemporary supermarket are the endpoint of global logistic supply chains, in all their logistical, value-transforming and brand-mediated hypercomplexity (see [@Neilson_2012; @Tsing_2009]).  Groceries imply a planetary geography of agriculture, industry, transport, communication and financialisation animated by flows of labour and capital. Encounters between this hyper-complex commodity-geography and people, even in the familiar confines of a supermarket, are no simple matter, either for shoppers or for supermarket operators such as Tesco.

# C. Shopping  lists and  a theory of social ordering 

The anthropologist  Daniel Miller has argued [@Miller_2012] that  shopping takes place as a negotiation of discrepancies between normative and actual social order (for instance, between ideals of health and commitments to thrift). What Miller suggests here is that ... [TBA]  It can also be seen  as a sacrificial ritual that re-instates social order in various ways. 

From an ethnomethodological standpoint, shopping lists provide important clues to how local social order is constituted, maintained, and repaired. Social ordering is done in shopping, and the shopping list as an inscriptive device stabilises certain forms of ordering at the expense of other possible orderings.  

The shopping list, whether written on the back of an envelope, or saved as a list in an online grocery shopping system, lies at the intersection of logistical flows, infrastructural orderings, and  lively negotiations around actual and normative social orders.  Shopping lists, therefore  are intersectional ordering devices that encapsulates a universe of possible references, and a teeming multitude of propensities with an actual local order (in both senses of that term: an ordering and an imperative). As people shop, either by  trawling along aisles packed with thousands of products, or scrolling down screens or searching for particular brands amidst search results, lists inscribe some kind of order that filters or reduces the excessive propensities, claims, dazzle and distraction of commodities to the practicalities of domestic economy.

Hand-written shopping lists undoubtedly have ongoing importance and display interestingly mixed ordering practices (see the montage of handwritten shopping lists at [Grocery List](http://www.grocerylist.org)). But online shopping lists take shape at the intersection of web and internet infrastructures, supply chain logistics, individualised practices and *habitus,* and increasingly, the predictive operations of  recommender systems. Just as the aisles and shelves of a supermarket present a densely-woven semiotics of objects competing for visual attention by offering distinctions of taste, thrift, expedience, novelty, indulgence, health and increasingly, online shopping recommender systems generate lists that seek to align people to commodities that they otherwise might have little relation to (see [@Turow_2015] for an overview).  

If, as the social anthropologist Jack Goody argues, lists are historically primary as forms of writing in urbanizing cultures [@Goody_1986], and if list-making and its later variants (e.g. tables) precede discursive and narrative writing practices, then we might expect lists to function as powerful social ordering devices. More recent sociological work on lists (see [@deGoede_2016] for an overview) explore the social and political potency of lists as ordering devices. As literary scholars suggest (see [@Mainberger_2003]), even if lists have often been de-valued as literary forms, list-making commonly appears in literary form whenever writing seeks to address, name, group or evoke totality, profusion, excess or abundance. From both  anthropological and literary perspectives, shopping lists have excellent reasons to exist: they are deeply rooted in organisational life and infrastructures. Lists weave together people, infrastructures, things, and places.[^1.456]    

[^1.456]: While lists intersect strongly with other meaning and sense-making practices in everyday life and popular culture, they can be refractory to discourse  and textual analysis methods built around models of language or speech, with its rules of syntax and grammar. On the one hand, lists are highly associative. They can be interpreted or decoded semiotically, although they exhibit  variations in textuality -- how they are written and read -- that thwart semiotic readings. On the other hand, as operational inscriptions, they can be treated ethnomethodologically, as the production of social order in a given setting. We might, in the light of their mutability, permeability and embedding in social order,  approach lists from various theoretical angles -- as asignifying semiotics as Maurizio Lazzarato calls it in his _Signs and Machines_ [@Lazzarato_2014] or as elements in 'a new order of spatio-temporal continuity for forms of economic, political and cultural life' as Celia Lury puts it in her account of topological turn [@Lury_2012].

Finally, and more formally, we might also consider some of the formal properties of lists as orderings. All lists imply order, but what kind of order? Mathematicians distinguish lists from sets on the basis of a distinction focused on order. Formally, both lists and sets are collections, but a list also contains a mapping of its elements to an ordering, usually the natural or counting numbers. Sometimes this order is explicit. Numbers are written down one side of the list. Often the order is implicit to the spatial arrangement of the list. This formal idea of the list as a mapping is helpful since it suggests relational possibilities. Mappings occasion relations between sets, collections, group or multiplicities.  Mappings between list order and social order are manifestly highly contingent. A flight checklist differs greatly from a personal to-do list, even if they share many formal properties.  Listing practices in a given social setting, therefore, always index an engagement between the formal properties of the list and the necessarily more fluid dynamics of social order. From the perspective of social order, shopping lists, as they are co-constructed by a supermarket chain's recommender system, might be important intersectional zones for the conversion of average everydayness through data-analytic propensities.

# D. Archaeology of recommendations  from 1984  to 2007

The main narrative of Patel's presentation concerned a shift from a well-established loyalty-card based data-mining model to a predictive, probabilistic, personally relevant re-writing of the shopping list in almost-realtime. The changes Patel described are increasingly widespread and common. While they are configured in Tesco-specific ways by DunnHumby (and this reflects a longer history), they are also broadly typical. Tesco is the largest supermarket chain in UK, famous amongst retailers for its  customer loyalty and targeted marketing programme known as 'Tesco Clubcard,' which started in 1991. DunnHumby -- founded by operations researchers Edwina Dunn and Clive Humby -- is said to have convinced the CEO of Tesco sometime in 1991 that a loyalty card program could change the supermarket chain's relationship to its customers.  Clive Humby's academic publications  are hard to track down, but an early paper given at the _Conference of Young Operational Researchers_ in Nottingham in 1984 suggests the direction that he, DunnHumby and later Tesco would take in constructing lists [@OKeefe_1984]. The abstract for Humby's presentation pre-figures an ongoing trajectory for data mining techniques aimed at eliciting detailed information on individual customer preferences.

While Tesco  succeeded in data-mining its customers using demographic segmentation,  and perhaps became the UK's biggest supermarket with the help of data-mining in the 1990s, the shopping environment  in 2017 is markedly different [@Turow_2017]. It is no longer organised around campaigns involving special offers or redemption of points for demographically segmented loyal customers (DunnHumby made heavy use of UK Census data). It can no longer rely on placement of goods in carefully chosen locations in stores. It needs or at least might want to continuously up-sell and cross-sell to customers who might hardly ever visits the supermarket itself. 

How could we characterise the shift from ClubCard data mining to online grocery markets?  If 'Tesco is the clear winner in the online grocery market, in fact it takes almost 50p of every £1 spent on food shopping on the internet' [How SEO helps Tesco to dominate the online grocery market](https://econsultancy.com/blog/64841-how-seo-helps-tesco-to-dominate-the-online-grocery-market)[@Silverwood-Cope_2014], then Tesco itself has undergone some kind of conversion? Patel described her work at DunnHumby as shifting the recommender system from a 'rules-based list' to a 'relevancy model.' The relevancy model changed how the 'Have You Forgotten' list was constructed.   This shift is a typical of broader re-organisation of prediction in which existing data analysis practices are being re-distributed and intensified in particular ways. The shift in models results in a more probabilistic structuring of lists.  The ostensible banality of the 'Have you forgotten?' recommendations betrays micrological signs of a topologically complex predictive infrastructure that intervenes in list-based social ordering to reconfigure alignments between people and things. 

This is not a drastic or abrupt event. Academic researchers first began writing about recommender systems in the mid-1990s. From the outset they highlighted a potential shift from demographic-driven market research or data mining techniques to personalized recommendations. For instance, writing in 1997 in a special section of the _Communications of the ACM_ on recommender systems, Paul Resnick and Hal Varian (at that time Dean of Information Sciences at UC Berkeley, but currently Chief Economist at Google), made much of this personalisation [@Resnick_1997]. Resnick and Varian  emphasise the need to distinguish the emerging practices from data mining: 

> In everyday life, we rely on recommendations from other people. ... Recommender systems augment this natural social process. In a typical recommender  system, people provide recommendations as inputs, which the system then aggregates and directs to appropriate recipients. In some cases the primary transformation is in the aggregation; in others the system’s value lies in its ability to make good matches between the recommenders and those seeking recommendations.[@Resnick_1997,56] 

Writing just after the advent of web-based e-Commerce, Resnick and Varian  imagined recommender systems augmenting the 'collaborative filtering' that people do when they write and read reviews of products and services (for instance, on the travel website, TripAdvisor; [@Scott_2012]). In 1997,  Resnick and Varian thought that 'people provide recommendations' and recommender systems would aggregate and rank for recipients. A slightly later review, [@Schafer_2001], diagrams an augmented 'natural social process' with a range of elements, technologies, inputs and outputs, with varying degrees of personalization. 

The conversion of  collaborative filtering into predictive personalisation appeared in Patel's presentations. Patel describes the move from 'a rules-based system'  to  a 'personal relevance model'. Each term in that phrase -- personal, relevance and model -- has some weight in the conversion event. We can assume that what Patel describes as  the 'rule-based system' refers  to the `apriori` algorithm, developed  by Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikanti at IBM Research Alameda in the early 1990s [@Agrawal_1994]. A now-classic approach to 'market basket analysis,' it was listed as one of the top ten data mining algorithms in a survey conducted amongst data miners [@Wu_2008] and usually attracts a chapter in data-mining and machine learning textbooks (e.g. [@Hastie_2009]).
