Based on the reviewers' comments, we are recommending major revisions for your manuscript.

There are several areas of broad agreement in the reviewers’ comments, which should be addressed when making your revisions, including:

>Clarify the central narrative and structure, and clearly articulate the contribution related to personalization and individuals, per R2.

>Clearly justify methods and disciplines used and referred to.

>Clarify the discussion related to lists, per R1.

>Develop the discussion related to object research more fully to establish the importance to social research, per R3.

>Indicate how the analysis of online shopping might carry through to other personalization contexts (or not), per R2.

>Address additional adaptive systems for e-commerce, per R1.

>Ensure that the introductory and abstract material carry through to the conclusion, per R3.

The reviewers have also made a number of detailed comments and corrections that you will be helpful in making your revisions.

We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript taking the above notes specifically into account, as well as the detailed comments provided in the reviews.

Comments to the Author
The author, refreshingly compared to many today, grounds their work clearly in the history of the field of personalisation in retail. They contrast the shopping lists as we know them, to the shopping lists online, and show how in the context of a supermarket "have you forgotten?" recommender list, 'conversion' is perhaps not the same as 'personalisation'.

I recommend this paper for publication with minor revisions. I found a few issues which are easily resolved (numbered with pages below). 

The most significant change I would like to see would be the situating of "conversion events" within the literature on adaptive media and hypertext online, which has studied this area in depth. While this paper draws on a single presentation and a corporate strategy, it misses out the broad literature on adaptive systems for e-commerce, particularly from the Web Science field. It would be useful further grounding to understand whether the author's conclusions applied more broadly outside of this case study, and would be of great benefit to situate this work and thought in an interdisciplinary manner.

See Goy A., Ardissono L., Petrone G. (2007) Personalization in E-Commerce Applications. In: Brusilovsky P., Kobsa A., Nejdl W. (eds) The Adaptive Web. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 4321. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-72079-9_16 for a review of some of this literature.

See also the widely used framework of the phases of the adaptive process in e-commerce, (Kobsa et al, Personalised hypermedia presentation techniques for improving online customer relationships).

Lastly (before the small amendments), the conclusion does not clearly allude to the last sentence of the abstract, of the incompleteness of lists and their expansion or contraction, which I believe is a shame as that is a strong take-away message of the paper.

p 2, API = Application Programm*ing* Interface, not programmer. Pluralisation generally is an API, multiple APIs, so that also reads a little strangely and you may wish to change it.

p 3 line 36 Spelling error, "Have you[r] forgotten?"

page 5 line 11: Sudden turn to online shopping lists is a little jarring. Needs a sentence leading into how lists may or may not be like recommender systems. A discussion, either here or somewhere in the paper, of the different user interfaces that characterise recommender systems would be useful. What are the affordances of a handwritten list, for example, and how does this compare to the affordances of an online 'list'?

Figure 3: I suggest that you arrange the items in descending order of item count, as there is no real value to alphabetical order in this context. In addition, the X and the Y axis are incorrectly labelled.

page 14, list as a relational field: I would think that there is also an economic part of the model as well as a propensity part. A low mark up item with a high propensity of conversion might be less desirable to show by the basket than a high mark up item with medium propensity. Perhaps this is not the case in Patel's model, but it is an area worth exploring and considering.

Comments to the Author
This paper sets out to argue that personalization based on large-scale datasets, as part of a broader change in probabalization, is not actually about targeting individuals. I find this thesis fascinating, and was excited to read a paper unpacking it in detail. Unfortunately, in its current form, the paper fails to do so. While I was able to draw some implicit connections between the social and technical phenomena described, a clear and coherent argument is never made to explain the diminishing (or perhaps misinterpreted?) role of individuals in personalization.

In general, the paper is very interesting in places, but lacks a central narrative. The choice of online shopping is justified in the introduction, but not carried through. The reader is not provided with specifics about how the analysis may translate to other personalization contexts, despite this being promised. To be publishable, the paper requires significant editing to provide a clear narrative that is carried throughout and reflected in the paper’s structure. Some methodological simplification may assist in this task.

Some specific comments:

p.1 - What's the value of this dual definition of ‘conversion event’ to the paper? It seems to introduce an unnecessary confusion of terminology. The first usage, of a conversion event as a purchase of sorts, is much more common. The second usage of the term could be replaced by ‘watershed’ or something similar, to indicate the adoption of a data analytics approach.

p.2 – The methodology is introduced here, and I find it extremely confusing and lacking justification. Throughout the paper, attention is drawn to a conference presentation given by a dunnhumby employee. While focusing on the description of dunnhumby’s personalisation system makes sense insofar as it gives the paper grounding, it’s not clear what the ethnographic insights throughout actually add to the analysis. Why is it, for example, important on p.15 to note that the speaker takes for granted the audience’s familiarity with central analytics concepts? This type of problem speaks to the methodological confusion holding the paper back; it’s unclear in what sense each component of the methodology (ethnography, anthropology, sociology) actually adds value to the paper. The reader is left to find value themselves, which is easier to do in some places than others (the contribution of Popper’s theory is, for example, very evident throughout). Significant justification and contextualisation of the methodological choices made is badly needed.

p.2 – Are the data or code used in the experiments mentioned openly available to readers?

p.3 – The paper states “With some forbearance on the part of readers, however, the argument of the paper should resonate sociologically. It concerns the relationality of social life, or the consistency and regularity of relating and acting amid a world in where probabilities and calculations based on probabilities are widespread.” I cannot work out the intended meaning of these sentences. There are many instances, particularly when sociological theory is discussed, that the text becomes very dense and difficult to understand.

p.6 – Why is footnote 5 not included in the main text? It seems highly relevant, and is very long.

p.6 – The intended purpose of the historical section of the paper is unclear in its overall structure. In particular, the connection to section 5 is not self-evident. If the intention is to review the history of personalisation in shopping, could this not have been achieved in a paragraph or two at most?

p.14 – What is the purpose of describing the limitations of association rule systems? The insights are very interesting, but their connection to the thesis of the article remains unclear. This is indicative of a broader problem with the thesis of the paper being unclear beyond the introduction; it does not translate into a clear structure/narrative.

Comments to the Author
This is one of the best papers I have read for some time. It integrates a new theoretical perspective (via Popper) into some rather tired territory. It also makes an important critique of personalization that is long needed, especially in the context of Big data theorization. It is fairly well research and offers an important case study.

I have only one suggestion for revision, though I have indicated that I would be happy to see this published as is as well. The introduction makes a rather quick reference to object-oriented research, from the likes of Bogost, Marres, etc. There is an important foreshadowing here of the larger 'social' argument, but it is too fleeting. I would suggest adding another paragraph here to flush out the significance for readers. I am familiar with the authors cited, but others may not as much. Otherwise, again I see this as a fantastic paper that I myself would cite in my own work and would recommend to others as well.
