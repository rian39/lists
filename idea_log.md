- list on wikipedia
- working memory and its addressability
- job listings -- the Kaggle contest on this - but it is only in relation to testing 
- program listings and the problem of branches and the flow of control
- image as a list -- AlphaGo
- text as a list -- RNN
- discussion amongst programmers of why they hardly ever use 'lists'
- python list comprehension
- intel i7 and samsung branch prediction
- lists of ingredients in Chef Watson
- blockchain as an unchangeable list

- Godel numbers as lists
- 'have you forgotten' list at Tesco

## Theory
- Fuller quotes
- Whitehead on sequences and series
- Stuart on sequences
- Badiou on sequences
- lists article in _Devices_ book

## to-do
- look at information retrieval textbooks -- Manning, etc
- go through Whitehead mathematics notes on sequences and series: DONE
- go through _Elements of Statistical Learning_ for stuff on lists and ranking: do they deal with it? 

## Tue Aug 23 08:41:32 BST 2016

- 'list' of ideas for this paper
- lists as sequences, and how sequences converge: this is only known through summation (Whitehead) and convergence to a limit; which links lists to neighbourhoods and ideas of convergence; via sequence, can also get into vector space
- listings -- program code -- and lists of instructions executed by programs  -- and what differences listings make; why doesn't anyone really refer to program listings anymore
- the list as predictive site -- how are lists becoming predictive: this could include many ranked lists (e.g. search results); -- but also the very architecture of the CPU itself as a predictive process.  -- the branch prediction idea and the way it allows pipelining of processes
- ranking and lists: the obvious connection is ranking, but what if I don't want to do ranking? 
- the substrate of lists and their space -- a topological account?
- focus on the operations of listing, including indexing, ordering, ranking, rewriting, and retrieving
- does the work on working memory, or on recursive processes help in exploring what is going on with lists?
- could keep things simple and just focus on 'listings' dealt with in machine learning - how is a ranking actually done in  a model and why would that matter. The answer is probabilistic?  
- lists and the problems of scale 

## Wed Aug 24 09:09:36 BST 2016

- what if lists are fundamentally changing in nature because they are becoming probabilistic, vectorised and optimised.   The key question would be how to demonstrate that. 
- large lists, indefinite lists, infinite lists ... how do they matter?  Because the series they produce becomes a kind of limit
- second main idea: massive expansion of lists -- everything is a list (e.g. images, text, etc)


## Fri Aug 26 11:14:10 BST 2016

 - finalising title; had idea about lists that change and those that don't; lists that adapt to individual circumstance and those that seek maximum stabilisation; are there enough tensions between the agent and structures, between change and stability; between control/order and event/invention to explore here? Tensions between predictive or probabilised lists (that adapt fully to context) and those that seek to minimise change (blockchain, working memory, sequence forms,etc.) 

## Mon Sep  5 13:27:05 BST 2016

- started looking at Godel numbers and Godel sequences, and from there got to the lists entry on wikipedia. Can think of stream as an infinite list, and this seems to be a useful way of thinking about lists in their contemporary form -- they are open ended; they contain time-orderings, but these orderings are not fixed. Could look at stream processing as an extension of lists; and then run an argument about scale. Do we oppose scale? Do we scale? What about scaleability?

- just listened to Shreena Patel from DunnHumby speaking about 'Have you forgotten?' in the shopping basket at Tesco. Really interesting description of the pipeline for the recommendations that are shown at the end. Could base the whole talk around this rather than the high-falutin talk I've sent in. Shopping lists are the prosaic example I've been looking for. 
- see pages  43-47, **August 2016** notebook 

## Mon Sep 26 08:34:00 BST 2016

- went through Shreena Patel DunnHumby presentation and turned it into around 10 points that could be the basis of the presentation. 
- would be good to have her presentation. 
- emailed her for it
- put the 10 or so main points into presentation order and started to write some notes around these
- could also point to (Recommender Systems Conference)[https://recsys.acm.org/recsys16/] as an example -- spent some time looking through these -- interesting papers on Youtube deeplearning, which I put in archive (~/archive/data_intensive/machine_learning/covington_youtube_deeplearning_2016.pdf). See there how matrix factorization has been been the main approach for recommender systems. 
- would like to simulate some of the things that Patel talked about. 
- got paper on Trilling, Kinsey Report -- started to think about all the accumulation of data in recommender systems. How long has this been happening? Tesco Clubcard seen as an origin, but customer/business analytics must be much older. How older? TODO: WoS search on research literature - DONE
- did a bit of this -- first mention of the term is highly cited 1997 ACM article by Varian & Resnick; describes some existing systems; point to the term 'collaborative filtering' as first used in 1991; paper is in archive ~/archive/data_intensive/machine_learning/varian_resnick_recommenders_1997.pdf
- 1997 special issue of ACM on recsys? Not sure. Went through time in WoS a bit and found 2001 article on recommender systems -- Schafer et al ~/archive/data_intensive/machine_learning/schafer_recommenders_ecommerce_2001.pdf -- which is a bit better. Has a lot of taxonomies and late 1990s references 
- TODO: go through the main points and think about where I can put my own stuff in; 
- TODO: look up ethnomethodology on lists ...
- TODO: go through book manuscript looking for points of intersection - could be on population; the table; optimisation/function; dimensionality;    

## Tue Sep 27 09:12:58 BST 2016

- started looking for any literature on Amazon recommendation engine -- found their ML service; much discussion of how important recommendations have been ... downloaded Linden's amazon paper; quite useful for all its material on the problems of large scale ... 
- tried to find Humby's work -- only one paper in Journal of Market Research, 1999, 'New developments in demographic targeting--the implications of 1991.'i about the ACORN system; this 1989 paper not n the archives of Market Research Society -- too early.  Found abstract for a paper given at 'young OR conference' in 1994. 
- Took screenshot of Humby 1984 and saved in figures folder -- it will be a slide ... 
- following leads on collaborative filtering -- how it differs from market basket analysis; how item-based and user-based CF techniques differ; tutorials in R on these
- also thinking about ordinals and well-ordered sets again: recommendation lists are well-ordered sets; in that sense they are something like ordinal numbers; that is, ways of describing well-ordered sets. 'Ordinal numbers are thus the "labels" needed to arrange collections of objects in order.' writes Wikipedia. 
- did search on 'lists' in my notes and made file lists.md. Has useful stuff from Lury, Lazzarato, Fuller, d 
- looking at this blog (Salem Marafi)[http://www.salemmarafi.com/code/market-basket-analysis-with-r/], installed arulesViz and played a bit with Grocery dataset.  
- wrote an intro to list, highlighting problems of how to study them as forms of order, and how to participate in them
- TODO: follow up on the Hobbes problem of social order: are new forms of operational changing that social problem. No longer contract, economic relations, etc. ... 
- feel better about getting some code for arules in the paper -- this is something that I've wanted to do anyway
- brought in all of Salem Marafi's code just to play with it -- will need more commentary to make sense of it. Am I saying that the shift in models from arules to CF is important? In what ways?

## Wed 28 Sep 09:33:36 BST 2016

- will look at the most interesting bits of dunnhumby presentation first, and then see if the other bits can be fitted in time ... 
- wrote a bit about arules and apriori, trying to link it to set theory; 
- TODO: find old shopping list and scan it DONE
- added a bit of badiou, but I'm not convinced.
- got distracted by non-human book (Grusin) and spent time downloading Hansen's article on prediction. And then Bogost on carpentry. 
- added a bit more on the badiou front -- the open and excess.
- TODO: image of a ClubCard
- spent time pasting itemset from `Groceries` dataset into Tesco's shopping list. Data is in data/grocery_items.csv. Can paste the whole list into the shopping site, or use the url (http://www.tesco.com/groceries/Product/Search/Default.aspx?notepad=yogurt&newSort=true)[http://www.tesco.com/groceries/Product/Search/Default.aspx?notepad=yogurt&newSort=true] substituting any term you want into it to get the results.  Would need to scrape a bit to get them all. Can get the number and then step through using http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/search/default.aspx?notepad=chicken&viewMode=grid&N=0&Nao=40 
- tracking down the `Groceries` dataset -- found reference in reference.pdf for `arules`. Added this to archive ~/archives/data_intensive/machine_learning/ 
- what do the brands do?

## Thu Sep 29 09:31:46 BST 2016

- Played this game at the tea table:   'I went shopping and bought '  -- this game is an example of a well-ordered set, since it labels every item with a letter of the alphabet, and those letters are well-ordered.  
- the game is about remembering what is in the list, and the alphabet helps remind you.
- could use this game at the opening.  The baseline account of lists as a form of number. 
- wrote a bit about this at the beginning -- it feels a bit better than other stuff because it gets into sets
- added in Hansen on prediction and how probability becomes actual ... Also put quotes in new notes file. His argument that prediction is a closed probabilistic determination of propensities that always exceed it as a field of data. The goal is to locate those excesses and perceptualise them somehow.  
- TODO: bring the quote about technical interface to the data of sensibility into the conclusion
- read some Hansen at lunch and marked useful bits on paper copy -- TODO: put those into notes file and then use them to structure the argument?
- started to bring some of the probability idea into 'I went shopping and I bought ...'
