- 'list' of ideas for this paper
    - lists as sequences, and how sequences converge: this is only known through summation (Whitehead) and convergence to a limit; which links lists to neighbourhoods and ideas of convergence; via sequence, can also get into vector space
    - listings -- program code -- and lists of instructions executed by programs  -- and what differences listings make; why doesn't anyone really refer to program listings anymore
    - the list as predictive site -- how are lists becoming predictive: this could include many ranked lists (e.g. search results); -- but also the very architecture of the CPU itself as a predictive process.  -- the branch prediction idea and the way it allows pipelining of processes
    - ranking and lists: the obvious connection is ranking, but what if I don't want to do ranking? 
    - the substrate of lists and their space -- a topological account?
    - focus on the operations of listing, including indexing, ordering, ranking, rewriting, and retrieving
    - does the work on working memory, or on recursive processes help in exploring what is going on with lists?

## possible titles

Lists and prediction
Lists as predictive setting
List in a predictive configuration

## simple examples
- `ls` -- what is the history of this? See Stallman and MacKenzie
- indexes -- Abbott on this
- indexing of elements in data structures and in mathematical forms
- list on wikipedia
- working memory and its addressability


## Theory
- Fuller quotes
- Whitehead on sequences and series
- Stuart on sequences
- Badiou on sequences


## to-do

- look at information retrieval textbooks -- Manning, etc
- go through Whitehead mathematics notes on sequences and series
- go through _Elements of Statistical Learning_ for stuff on lists and ranking: do they deal with it?
