## possible titles

Lists that always change and lists that hardly ever change
What is not a list?
Lists as prediction
List heterogeneity: change and stability
Predictive listing
Lists and prediction
Lists as predictive setting
List in a predictive configuration
Streams as lists: the problem of lists in time
**Streams, pipelines and trees: living with unending lists**

## simple examples of lists
- `ls` -- what is the history of this? See Stallman and MacKenzie; also cat, etc. 
- indexes -- Abbott on this
- indexing of elements in data structures and in mathematical forms
- list on wikipedia
- working memory and its addressability
- job listings -- the Kaggle contest on this - but it is only in relation to testing 
- program listings and the problem of branches and the flow of control
- image as a list -- AlphaGo
- text as a list -- RNN
- discussion amongst programmers of why they hardly ever use 'lists'
- python list comprehension
- intel i7 and samsung branch prediction
- lists of ingredients in Chef Watson
- blockchain as an unchangeable list
- streams as indefinite lists
- Godel numbers as lists
- 'have you forgotten' list at Tesco

## Theory
- Fuller quotes
- Whitehead on sequences and series
- Stuart on sequences
- Badiou on sequences
- lists article in _Devices_ book

## to-do

- look at information retrieval textbooks -- Manning, etc
- go through Whitehead mathematics notes on sequences and series
- go through _Elements of Statistical Learning_ for stuff on lists and ranking: do they deal with it?

- 'list' of ideas for this paper
- lists as sequences, and how sequences converge: this is only known through summation (Whitehead) and convergence to a limit; which links lists to neighbourhoods and ideas of convergence; via sequence, can also get into vector space
- listings -- program code -- and lists of instructions executed by programs  -- and what differences listings make; why doesn't anyone really refer to program listings anymore
- the list as predictive site -- how are lists becoming predictive: this could include many ranked lists (e.g. search results); -- but also the very architecture of the CPU itself as a predictive process.  -- the branch prediction idea and the way it allows pipelining of processes
- ranking and lists: the obvious connection is ranking, but what if I don't want to do ranking? 
- the substrate of lists and their space -- a topological account?
- focus on the operations of listing, including indexing, ordering, ranking, rewriting, and retrieving
- does the work on working memory, or on recursive processes help in exploring what is going on with lists?
- could keep things simple and just focus on 'listings' dealt with in machine learning - how is a ranking actually done in  a model and why would that matter. The answer is probabilistic?  
- lists and the problems of scale 

## Wed Aug 24 09:09:36 BST 2016

- what if lists are fundamentally changing in nature because they are becoming probabilistic, vectorised and optimised.   The key question would be how to demonstrate that. 
- large lists, indefinite lists, infinite lists ... how do they matter?  Because the series they produce becomes a kind of limit
- second main idea: massive expansion of lists -- everything is a list (e.g. images, text, etc)


## Fri Aug 26 11:14:10 BST 2016

 - finalising title; had idea about lists that change and those that don't; lists that adapt to individual circumstance and those that seek maximum stabilisation; are there enough tensions between the agent and structures, between change and stability; between control/order and event/invention to explore here? Tensions between predictive or probabilised lists (that adapt fully to context) and those that seek to minimise change (blockchain, working memory, sequence forms,etc.)

- started looking at Godel numbers and Godel sequences, and from there got to the lists entry on wikipedia. Can think of stream as an infinite list, and this seems to be a useful way of thinking about lists in their contemporary form -- they are open ended; they contain time-orderings, but these orderings are not fixed. Could look at stream processing as an extension of lists; and then run an argument about scale. Do we oppose scale? Do we scale? What about scaleability?

- just listened to Shreena Patel from DunnHumby speaking about 'Have you forgotten?' in the shopping basket at Tesco. Really interesting description of the pipeline for the recommendations that are shown at the end. Could base the whole talk around this rather than the high-falutin talk I've sent in. Shopping lists are the prosaic example I've been looking for. 
- see pages  43-47, **August 2016** notebook

- went through Shreena Patel DunnHumby presentation and turned it into around 10 points that could be the basis of the presentation. 
- would be good to have her presentation. 
- emailed her for it
- put the 10 or so main points into presentation order and started to write some notes around these
- could also point to (Recommender Systems Conference)[https://recsys.acm.org/recsys16/] as an example -- spent some time looking through these -- interesting papers on Youtube deeplearning, which I put in archive (~/archive/data_intensive/machine_learning/covington_youtube_deeplearning_2016.pdf). See there how matrix factorization has been been the main approach for recommender systems. 
- would like to simulate some of the things that Patel talked about. 
- got paper on Trilling, Kinsey Report -- started to think about all the accumulation of data in recommender systems. How long has this been happening? Tesco Clubcard seen as an origin, but customer/business analytics must be much older. How older? TODO: WoS search on research literature - DONE
- did a bit of this -- first mention of the term is highly cited 1997 ACM article by Varian & Resnick; describes some existing systems; point to the term 'collaborative filtering' as first used in 1991; paper is in archive ~/archive/data_intensive/machine_learning/varian_resnick_recommenders_1997.pdf
- 1997 special issue of ACM on recsys? Not sure. Went through time in WoS a bit and found 2001 article on recommender systems -- Schafer et al ~/archive/data_intensive/machine_learning/schafer_recommenders_ecommerce_2001.pdf -- which is a bit better. Has a lot of taxonomies and late 1990s references 
- TODO: go through the main points and think about where I can put my own stuff in; 
- TODO: look up ethnomethodology on lists ...
- TODO: go through book manuscript looking for points of intersection
