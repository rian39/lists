## Theory
- Fuller quotes
- Whitehead on sequences and series
- Stuart on sequences
- Badiou on sequences
- lists article in _Devices_ book
- hansen on prediction

## to-do
- look at information retrieval textbooks -- Manning, etc
- go through Whitehead mathematics notes on sequences and series: DONE
- go through _Elements of Statistical Learning_ for stuff on lists and ranking: do they deal with it? 

## Tue Aug 23 08:41:32 BST 2016

- 'list' of ideas for this paper
- lists as sequences, and how sequences converge: this is only known through summation (Whitehead) and convergence to a limit; which links lists to neighbourhoods and ideas of convergence; via sequence, can also get into vector space
- listings -- program code -- and lists of instructions executed by programs  -- and what differences listings make; why doesn't anyone really refer to program listings anymore
- the list as predictive site -- how are lists becoming predictive: this could include many ranked lists (e.g. search results); -- but also the very architecture of the CPU itself as a predictive process.  -- the branch prediction idea and the way it allows pipelining of processes
- ranking and lists: the obvious connection is ranking, but what if I don't want to do ranking? 
- the substrate of lists and their space -- a topological account?
- focus on the operations of listing, including indexing, ordering, ranking, rewriting, and retrieving
- does the work on working memory, or on recursive processes help in exploring what is going on with lists?
- could keep things simple and just focus on 'listings' dealt with in machine learning - how is a ranking actually done in  a model and why would that matter. The answer is probabilistic?  
- lists and the problems of scale 

## Wed Aug 24 09:09:36 BST 2016

- what if lists are fundamentally changing in nature because they are becoming probabilistic, vectorised and optimised.   The key question would be how to demonstrate that. 
- large lists, indefinite lists, infinite lists ... how do they matter?  Because the series they produce becomes a kind of limit
- second main idea: massive expansion of lists -- everything is a list (e.g. images, text, etc)

## Fri Aug 26 11:14:10 BST 2016

 - finalising title; had idea about lists that change and those that don't; lists that adapt to individual circumstance and those that seek maximum stabilisation; are there enough tensions between the agent and structures, between change and stability; between control/order and event/invention to explore here? Tensions between predictive or probabilised lists (that adapt fully to context) and those that seek to minimise change (blockchain, working memory, sequence forms,etc.) 

## Mon Sep  5 13:27:05 BST 2016

- started looking at Godel numbers and Godel sequences, and from there got to the lists entry on wikipedia. Can think of stream as an infinite list, and this seems to be a useful way of thinking about lists in their contemporary form -- they are open ended; they contain time-orderings, but these orderings are not fixed. Could look at stream processing as an extension of lists; and then run an argument about scale. Do we oppose scale? Do we scale? What about scaleability? 


## Mon Sep 12 15:19:55 BST 2016

- just listened to Shreena Patel from DunnHumby speaking about 'Have you forgotten?' in the shopping basket at Tesco. Really interesting description of the pipeline for the recommendations that are shown at the end. Could base the whole talk around this rather than the high-falutin talk I've sent in. Shopping lists are the prosaic example I've been looking for. 
- see pages  43-47, **August 2016** notebook; now scanned as figure/single_patel.pdf

## Mon Sep 26 08:34:00 BST 2016

- went through Shreena Patel DunnHumby presentation and turned it into around 10 points that could be the basis of the presentation. 
- would be good to have her presentation. 
- emailed her for it
- put the 10 or so main points into presentation order and started to write some notes around these
- could also point to (Recommender Systems Conference)[https://recsys.acm.org/recsys16/] as an example -- spent some time looking through these -- interesting papers on Youtube deeplearning, which I put in archive (~/archive/data_intensive/machine_learning/covington_youtube_deeplearning_2016.pdf). See there how matrix factorization has been been the main approach for recommender systems. 
- would like to simulate some of the things that Patel talked about. 
- got paper on Trilling, Kinsey Report -- started to think about all the accumulation of data in recommender systems. How long has this been happening? Tesco Clubcard seen as an origin, but customer/business analytics must be much older. How older? TODO: WoS search on research literature - DONE
- did a bit of this -- first mention of the term is highly cited 1997 ACM article by Varian & Resnick; describes some existing systems; point to the term 'collaborative filtering' as first used in 1991; paper is in archive ~/archive/data_intensive/machine_learning/varian_resnick_recommenders_1997.pdf
- 1997 special issue of ACM on recsys? Not sure. Went through time in WoS a bit and found 2001 article on recommender systems -- Schafer et al ~/archive/data_intensive/machine_learning/schafer_recommenders_ecommerce_2001.pdf -- which is a bit better. Has a lot of taxonomies and late 1990s references 
- TODO: go through the main points and think about where I can put my own stuff in; DONE 
- TODO: look up ethnomethodology on lists ...
- TODO: go through book manuscript looking for points of intersection - could be on population; the table; optimisation/function; probabilisation, dimensionality; enunciative function;    

## Tue Sep 27 09:12:58 BST 2016

- started looking for any literature on Amazon recommendation engine -- found their ML service; much discussion of how important recommendations have been ... downloaded Linden's amazon paper; quite useful for all its material on the problems of large scale ... 
- tried to find Humby's work -- only one paper in Journal of Market Research, 1999, 'New developments in demographic targeting--the implications of 1991.'i about the ACORN system; this 1989 paper not n the archives of Market Research Society -- too early.  Found abstract for a paper given at 'young OR conference' in 1994. 
- Took screenshot of Humby 1984 and saved in figures folder -- it will be a slide ... 
- following leads on collaborative filtering -- how it differs from market basket analysis; how item-based and user-based CF techniques differ; tutorials in R on these
- also thinking about ordinals and well-ordered sets again: recommendation lists are well-ordered sets; in that sense they are something like ordinal numbers; that is, ways of describing well-ordered sets. 'Ordinal numbers are thus the "labels" needed to arrange collections of objects in order.' writes Wikipedia. 
- did search on 'lists' in my notes and made file lists.md. Has useful stuff from Lury, Lazzarato, Fuller, d 
- looking at this blog (Salem Marafi)[http://www.salemmarafi.com/code/market-basket-analysis-with-r/], installed arulesViz and played a bit with Grocery dataset.  
- wrote an intro to list, highlighting problems of how to study them as forms of order, and how to participate in them
- TODO: follow up on the Hobbes problem of social order: are new forms of operational changing that social problem. No longer contract, economic relations, etc. ... 
- feel better about getting some code for arules in the paper -- this is something that I've wanted to do anyway
- brought in all of Salem Marafi's code just to play with it -- will need more commentary to make sense of it. Am I saying that the shift in models from arules to CF is important? In what ways?

## Wed 28 Sep 09:33:36 BST 2016

- will look at the most interesting bits of dunnhumby presentation first, and then see if the other bits can be fitted in time ... 
- wrote a bit about arules and apriori, trying to link it to set theory; 
- TODO: find old shopping list and scan it DONE
- added a bit of badiou, but I'm not convinced.
- got distracted by non-human book (Grusin) and spent time downloading Hansen's article on prediction. And then Bogost on carpentry. 
- added a bit more on the badiou front -- the open and excess.
- TODO: image of a ClubCard -- DONE
- spent time pasting itemset from `Groceries` dataset into Tesco's shopping list. Data is in data/grocery_items.csv. Can paste the whole list into the shopping site, or use the url (http://www.tesco.com/groceries/Product/Search/Default.aspx?notepad=yogurt&newSort=true)[http://www.tesco.com/groceries/Product/Search/Default.aspx?notepad=yogurt&newSort=true] substituting any term you want into it to get the results.  Would need to scrape a bit to get them all. Can get the number and then step through using http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/search/default.aspx?notepad=chicken&viewMode=grid&N=0&Nao=40 
- tracking down the `Groceries` dataset -- found reference in reference.pdf for `arules`. Added this to archive ~/archives/data_intensive/machine_learning/ 
- what do the brands do?

## Thu Sep 29 09:31:46 BST 2016

- Played this game at the tea table:   'I went shopping and bought '  -- this game is an example of a well-ordered set, since it labels every item with a letter of the alphabet, and those letters are well-ordered.  
- the game is about remembering what is in the list, and the alphabet helps remind you.
- could use this game at the opening.  The baseline account of lists as a form of number. 
- wrote a bit about this at the beginning -- it feels a bit better than other stuff because it gets into sets
- added in Hansen on prediction and how probability becomes actual ... Also put quotes in new notes file. His argument that prediction is a closed probabilistic determination of propensities that always exceed it as a field of data. The goal is to locate those excesses and perceptualise them somehow.  
- TODO: bring the quote about technical interface to the data of sensibility into the conclusion
- read some Hansen at lunch and marked useful bits on paper copy -- TODO: put those into notes file and then use them to structure the argument?
- started to bring some of the probability idea into 'I went shopping and I bought ...' 

## Fri Sep 30 10:16:16 BST 2016

- pfaffing with rmarkdown, setting up shortcuts, etc. will be a help I think 
- trying to get to core of the issue- what is probabilistic and potentiating in the sense that Hansen speaks about ...  
- wrote python script to scrape all the product counts from tesco in the groceries list; took 1 hour; to get a total figure that is accurate I suppose
- saved results as csv data/tesco_groceries.csv and a did of them 
- eventually got somewhere with the Tesco data. Plotted it (> 50); 
- started writing about the number of combinations of these items they constitute a surplus of sensibility.  
- wrote some points for the conclusion

## Wed Oct  5 07:48:28 BST 2016
- have written about 2500 words, but need to get to the point: how does a subject of the list take shape in the data
- have finished reading the Hansen which is at ~/archive/Hansen feel like I want to get away from any opposition between the actual and the statistical, and say that the feeling of agency comes from the list.
- like the argument that subject is a feeling of the list ... and Hansen's argument in general about 'our predictive condition' 
- 'condition' reminds of Lyotard - downloaded and added to archive here ~/archive/Lyotard_Postmodern_Condition_1981.pdf great line there about continuous differentiable functions won't be the basis of prediction ... this quote in notes file ~/notes/lyotard_postmodern.md.  
- TODO: get quote on conversion and **relevance** and why it matters from Hansen
- also had an idea of thinking about an event that happens in recommender system -- does it ever happen that something is recommended that matters to me ... 
- TESCO api -- signed up for this but can't get key for API for some reason -- can't see it there, but its probably a distraction ... 
- TODO: scan Shreena's graph of the models and use as image. DONE
- went back to notes on 200000 products and looked at undersampling -- randomly drop some of the products to get a more balanced dataset; also see that much of the presentation was really about the topic of basket similarity and how to deal with it since it affects the **relevance** of the the recommendations. This is another tie-in to the Hansen argument. 
- thought too that the conversion experience Tesco wants -- no low value conversion -- is precisely what they are suffering from in competition with the German supermarkets that do no online delivery. 

## Thu  6 Oct 09:27:40 BST 2016

- scanned notes from notebook as figures. They are figure/single_patel.pdf as well as in single files 
- how to deal with surplus -- is that the issue? Could talk about the undersampling of the 200000 products.  
- went back to the TESCO api and actually managed to register properly
- wrote a small python script to get items -- actually more interested in the data that the api gives back. Its quite extensive in its attempts to qualify each item.
- got a bit into the 'unbalanced data' issue and started to write about that.

## Fri Oct  7 10:30:53 BST 2016
- writing scripts to get tesco products -- now have that working and can make montage of whole collections of products. tesco_get_groceries.py
- not sure why I did that -- can see no use for it except to a sense of the surplus of sensibility by showing montages. But what is the point of that?
- ran scripts enough times to get around 20k products. Might be overlap between categories, but this is about 10% of Tesco's product range in groceries .. 
- had idea of trying to simulate strange interests by working with the tesco data and then building models that could predict those.
- could also use the images to build classifiers; or use all the product metadata to construct new features and classifications
- had idea of trying to simulate strange interests by working with the tesco data and then building models that could predict those.
- could also use the images to build classifiers; or use all the product metadata to construct new features and classifications.
- added a bit of stuff on the experimental allocation of customers
- also started adding fragments of my notes as images; I'm hoping that I can write a script to extract the images and the knitr blocks into a presentation file and then present that.
- wrote script simulate_baskets.r to pull all the results into a single dataframe for tesco items and then use that to run queries against. 
- TODO: get some ideas on conversion from James' ~/archive/james_texts/james_varieties.pdf
- TODO: some more work on simulating the baskets and perhaps the customers using the GBCS data
- started to write a script to simulate baskets in terms of range of items, total cost, number of items,, etac 
- TODO: write r chunks in outline to extract high cost conversion items

## Mon Oct 10 09:27:43 BST 2016

- reread hansen a bit to get a sense of the actual argument: the main thing seems to be that it is not the event itself that matters but the organisation and accessing of the propensities in the world that come to light. 4  
- also the hansen point about re-thinking media as distributed in the world
- tried to track down the Vernes reference -- 1982, critique de raison aleatoire -- would need to ill that.
- wrote some on the uplift model -- turns out that has only recently come into marking (around 1999) and is under active development in market research. I thought it would be standard practice ...  downloaded a paper on it by Victor Lo 2002 ~/archive/data_intensive/markets/lo_lift_model_1982_10.1.1.99.7064.pdf
- uplift models are one of the ways that markets link machine learning into marketing ... 
- TODO: write script to extract all headings, quotes, images and knitr chunks to a file and then convert to ioslides, etc. 
- TODO: get some references for realtime in media: Hansen doesn't speak about this much -- might be able to adapt some of his temporality talk. ... 
- tried t write the infrastructure section -- not much to say about hadoop, except that without it, no lists ... is all of this a product of infrastructural transformation?

## Tue 11 Oct 09:27:24 BST 2016

- TODO: use montage to create image of all out.jpg as a slide
- had to rescan patel page 3 because it was cropped figure/patel_page3_SKM_C36816101109420.pdf
- went through paper adding a bit on classifiers and tangentially approaching the topic of basket similarity. 
- finding it hard to write about that bit of the presentation  - some small cues -- 'modelling substitutes'. Does that mean that they build models for reach product? Or for each of the recommendations in the 200 in the list? That is, a second layer of modelling that connects the recommendations to what is in the basket? Shreena talks about it in that way ...    

## Wed 12 Oct 11:41:17 BST 2016
- hard to get started today -- 11.41 and just starting. Spent quite a lot of time on poLCA and this doesn't have relation to the topic.  
- will try to write about the substitute and similarity modelling
- looking up Popper on propensity and downloaded to ~/archive/popper_propensities_1990.pdf; also printed it
- read it a bit and it might help in the discussion of the weighting of the list
- had the idea in the pool that I don't need to go much further except to say something about how media theory is grappling with the growth of prediction; premediation, etc. This also is an attempt to grapple with that. TODO: put into intro and conclusion 
- added extract_images.sh to create slides; TODO: try it with Rmarkdown reveal, etc. 

## Thu 13 Oct 15:58:47 BST 2016

- didn't get much time today, but did a little on slides -- putting in chunk options, which didn't seem to work, and trying to get slides working. Some of them come out, but not all. 

## Sun Oct 16 20:43:09 BST 2016

- playing with tint formatting, but didn't really get it working.
- managed to mess up the repo a bit by forgetting to pull down


## Mon 17 Oct 12:55:25 BST 2016
- still playing around with tufte, tint etc. Got it working reasonably well after an hour. Good example document is here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/tufte/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/tufte_html/skeleton/skeleton.Rmd
- also found Morris paper on recommender systems that I should read as point of comparison: TODO: DONE read and extract key points from ~/archive/data_intensive/morris_recommender_European Journal of Cultural Studies-2015-Morris-446-63.pdf and added some notes here morris_recommender_2015.md

- key thing to get it working is:
>library('tint'), render('test_tufte.rmd',output_format=tintPdf())

or
>render('test_tufte.rmd',output_format=ioslides_presentation())

- made a small script for this and added it as render_tufte.r
- modified it to run for lists_conversion_experience.rmd
