Dear Adrian:

I hope you are well. Very happy to receive a submission from you -  # BDS-17-0018 entitled "Probabilities and propensities: conversion experiences in online grocery shopping".

After an intense round of reviews and discussion about these, and given the number of revisions suggested by the reviewers, we are recommending that you revise and resubmit your article. The reviewer comments are included at the bottom of this letter. We struggled over this one but with two rejects (from well qualified researchers) we feel that some major reworking is needed. While there is agreement that your paper demonstrates a compelling engagement with machine learning, the reviewers felt that substantial revisions were necessary to make the arguments more precise.  We would welcome a significantly revised article, which we will send out as a new article for peer review.

We hope that you will take up these suggestions - especially the considerable work and investment on the part of the reviewers - and resubmit a new version.

Sincerely,
Evelyn

Comments to the Author
This manuscript addresses a topic of relevance to the journal and its readers, but flaws in the article’s structure and in its empirical support make the author’s specific argument (and thus their contribution to our understanding of lists, algorithmic recommendation, or grocery shopping) unclear. I have to recommend that it be rejected, because the revisions necessary would transform it into a new article.

Much of the article’s introduction concerns itself with repeating the idea that lists are consequential forms of social ordering, without making an argument why this is, or letting us see how the piece will proceed to analyze empirical detail to teach us something about the particularities of this kind of social ordering. The plan becomes slightly clearer by page 12, where a method is outlined. However, this method (engaging with an API) is only used momentarily, and the bulk of the piece relies on a single public presentation by a recommender systems researcher/engineer.

There are some technical misunderstandings through the middle of the piece, which seem to stem from reliance on this single public presentation and a self-guided literature review (which mixes older technical literatures and more recent critical literatures without distinguishing them). A revision of the piece would require more substantial engagement with empirical material—the brief description of interaction with an API is poorly contextualized and thus hard to integrate with the author’s argument. A reorganization of the piece and a clarification of its overall purpose and the purpose of its individual sections in relation to the broader argument are also necessary.

There are many provocative and interesting moments scattered throughout, but given the state of the manuscript, they are impressionistic rather than argued. Many of the claims are redundant and vague. There is evidence of a great deal of thought here, but it has not been adequately corralled into legible form for an article.

More detailed comments follow.

2.3 “but rather” - How do you know?
2.33 How can grocery shopping be seen as a sacrificial ritual? (This is intriguing, but seems tangential in its current brief state.)

2.53 Given the context, I’m not sure about the notion that shopping lists are “filters”—insofar as they can contain items that aren’t found at the store and do not necessarily limit the gaze of the consumer to their contents, they don’t seem much like other filters (which might, e.g., show you only the organic-certified items in an online catalog, and certainly could not generate items that were not already contained in that catalog). The difference is maybe minor, but seems to alter our theoretical understanding of what happens when list qua set of desired objects encounters store qua list of available objects (with perhaps unforeseen qualities like price that would result in the negotiation between normative and actual social order mentioned previously).

3.14 Is “Grocery List” meant to be a hyperlink?

3.19-31 This sentence (“Just as…”) seems to be missing a grammatical component. Also, “that they otherwise might have little relation to” is vague: what is a relation here? Knowledge of? Desire for? Contact with?

5.30 It is unclear what the source is for the description starting here (“Tesco’s recommender…”). How do we know that Tesco focuses on conversion events? (I don’t doubt that they do, but there’s no substantiation here.) Why is focusing on conversion events contradictory to being titled “have you forgotten”? (If you had forgotten something, had it recommended to you, and then bought it, this would also be a conversion event, and not contradictory at all—again, the author’s claim its plausible but unsubstantiated.)

6.8 This Popper quotation needs more scaffolding—what do the propensities of things have to do with what we’re talking about? Is the “thing” a recommender system here? What use is being made of Popper’s idea of “propensities” in particular, rather than the more general and obvious claim that “technologies have effects”?

6.34 I am quite enthusiastic about the effort to build on prior work to theorize the list, but this claim about Goody doesn’t follow: the fact that lists are ancient does not necessarily mean that they will be powerful social ordering devices. The subsequent discussion claims repeatedly that lists are social ordering devices, but doesn’t do much to explain how this claim is drawn from the literature. A more purposeful path through the literature review would help here. 

7.12 Given the mathematical distinction here, it seems that most shopping lists are in fact shopping sets, and while clearly some lists are ordered, the author does not indicate here why this paragraph is relevant to the discussion at hand. The paragraph does not seem to lead to or support the conclusion that shopping lists “might be important intersectional zones for the conversion of average everydayness through data-analytic propensities” (8.3).

7.42 This footnote is tangential to the argument.

8.33 For the interdisciplinary audience of this journal, the author could interpret this Hansen quotation a bit more, rather than closely paraphrasing it, as they do now. As I understand it, Hansen is claiming that predictive analytics depend on a probabilistic ontology, which would be a transformation from some other understanding of ontology. This seems to be a different interpretation than the author’s, which appears (8.48) to take the transformation in question to be not a historical one, on which the emergence of analytics depends, but rather something effected by analytics themselves. I may be missing some context from Hansen that supports the author’s reading (i.e. what the “this” on line 8.31 refers back to).

9.49 Related to the last point, the author’s effort to theorize “conversion” beyond the technical definition is intriguing, and should be brought up out of the footnotes and elaborated on more clearly!

9.33 Is this the source for the foregoing discussion of how the Tesco system works? It needs to happen earlier if the other material is not to read as though it’s supposed to be common knowledge.

10.31 The purpose of these tables of items is unclear.

11.45 Being this far along in the paper and encountering “we might” is discouraging: it is not yet clear how the author intends to actually pursue their argument (beyond demonstrating that lists are interesting, which they surely are, and that shopping lists in particular are interest, which, also yes).

12.16 This methodology should be indicated much earlier (and in the abstract), because it was a surprise to encounter here.

12.57 What is the “longer history”? If the reader can’t readily figure it out, then this is too elliptical a sidenote to include.

14.34 This figure seems like it should be text, rather than an image.

15.18 We don’t have a history of the “Have You Forgotten” list at this point, which would be useful to understand this transformation—how did it work as a rules-based list?

15.25 What are the “particular ways”? This is a bit of an issue with the piece overall up to this point: it gestures at arguments that might be made, without actually making them or giving the reader a sense of those arguments’ particularities. “The shift in models results in a more probabilistic structuring of lists,” for instance, seems to just repeat the rules-to-relevancy claim in a more verbose way. The point is just that “relevancy” *means* “probabilistic,” in this context.

16.3 This quotation does not, as its introduction suggests it would, say anything about data mining. And Resnick is not “making much” of recommendation—he is taking part in inventing it.

16.27 This slightly later review is not described in enough detail to communicate anything about it beyond that recommender systems have variable parts.

16.42 “We can assume…” - This seems unjustified: there are many ways to implement rules-based systems (and for many machine learning engineers, “rules-based” is something of a catch-all for any outdated system that cannot update its parameters dynamically), so it is quite a leap to pick out this one in particular.

18.56 The “beer-diaper association” is not well known enough to not be explained in this footnote, I don’t think.

19.21 The author appears to be describing what recommender systems researchers might call a “memory-based” “item-item” recommender. It is certainly meant to be predictive (contra 19.31), but it does not extrapolate statistically or involve any modeling of the user other than as a basket of goods.

19.50 Unclear where “demographic” comes from, given that the system described only knows item-item correlations. Is the idea that you might segment such a system into separate instances along demographic group boundaries?

22.17 This Hansen quote again needs more unpacking for this journal’s audience. This is also the second time that a term developed in the manuscript (here “surplus,” before “propensities”) is revealed after-the-fact to be primarily derived from Hansen’s work. I am unfamiliar with the Hansen, but would be concerned that the author do more to clarify exactly what his argument is overall and to demonstrate how this article is not merely a transposition of his terms.

22.54 Why? It seems I could equally say that such a model breaks open the person and constitutes them *through* the propensities of things.

23.52 Figure 6 is quite impenetrable, and might be better replaced by a rephrasing of the description in the paragraph at 24.16. “Precision” is not the only way to index a system’s “causal efficacy” and the difference between precision and other information retrieval measures like recall is quite important to understanding how these systems are evaluated.

24.37 “Why did she say little…” The answer to this question seems to depend on the audience, but it may be because logistic regression is a very simple, common kind of model; noting that it outperforms more complex systems like random forests is kind of funny, and thus points to the significance of using better *data* (and representations of that data, via features) rather than more sophisticated algorithms. This is a common trope in recommender researcher discourse.

24.55 Not all classifiers operate in vector spaces.

25.11 This is a very unlikely mechanism: more likely, if there is a vector space in play, the system will produce a ranked list of potential recommendations and then display some number of them off the top. If the system worked as described, it would be possible for the list of recommendations to include wildly variable amounts of goods.

25.18 “left and right hand side” - unclear what this is referring to

25.23 “precision” is a very old metric that does not require probabilities to work

25.24 “underlying shift” - this seems to be because the presenter is working from the assumption that all viable options are statistical models. There is no shift here, it has already happened, and the presenter is working within that normal science.

25.39-45 This doesn’t seem to tell us much, given that it is a single presentation not specifically aimed at outlining the entirety of a recommender apparatus.

27.49 How are features “ways of traversing”? 

27.54-28.8 This critique of Hansen is good, although it seems to run contrary to the piece’s endorsement of “delimitation” in its prior engagement with him.

28.25 I expected this section to start addressing features (i.e. the ways items are represented in the recommender), but this is something else.

29.11 This does not seem ironic (given the meaning of “predictive”), but moreover it is untrue: lots of evaluations happen on pre-given datasets, split into “Train” and “Test” groups, such that the qualities of the test group are predicted and then evaluated on already-existing data. These are generally considered less valuable than “live” tests, but live tests are generally only available to corporations and are more complex and expensive to run.

29.16 “perhaps significant” —is it significant or not? (To the argument of the article? To the makers of the systems? To users?)

29.28 This is just what an experiment is, in a classic sense.

30.18-28 This is what I was referring to in my complaint about ranked lists above; this seems to indicate that they are *not* using a classifier that draws a line between recommended and non-recommended products.

30.50 What is the difference between an “infrastructural” and an “analytic” scale? They both seem quite large. Are they differently large?

31.6 This infrastructure subsection did not seem to do very much.

31.19-24 Without a clear definition of “propensities,” this suggestion is impossible to interpret, and I am unable to determine the meaning of the rest of the paragraph.

32.31 “time and place” - We have not heard that these are features in the Tesco calculations before, so it is surprising to see them here as the fundamentally distinctive features of them.

32.56 “She mentioned…” This sentence seems to communicate that the author does not understand what the speaker was talking about—“L1 regularization,” for instance, is just mentioned in a way that communicates technical mystery, rather than functional detail.

33.23 This is a very interesting practice! The lead-up to it seemed like the point of the similarity matrix was to *avoid* similar items (to those in the cart), not to discover similar items (to those already in the recommendations) in order to put in higher prices. But, contra 33.25, this is still clearly a question of whether to recommend (and I had thought “micrological conversions” were a more theoretical term for describing recommendations, thus not contrary to them at all).

34.44-49 This is a very nice framing, and it would be good to see more discussion of precisely this point: how logistical ensembles relate to the negotiation described at the beginning of the piece (in the citation of Miller’s work on shopping).

35.43 I have to say that at this point it seems like the author may not actually know what “constructing good features” means—it is never defined or discussed in a way that reflects the use of the term in recommender systems research.

36.4 It’s Blake Hallinan and Ted Striphas.

36.20 This is a very nice, if fleeting, critique of Hallinan and Striphas (and maybe out of place at this point in the conclusion).

Comments to the Author
The paper examines the transformation of a shopping list in the age of machine learning. The authors compare the paper shopping list (written by a person), the list of recommendations from collaborative filtering/data-mining rule-based systems, and the list of recommendations from large scale machine learning. I agree with the authors that the practice of making a shopping list is important, and online recommendations can significantly chang consumption patterns and social order. It is an interesting and important research topic; I started reading the paper with excitement.

However, it is unclear what contributions this paper makes.
- The paper doesn’t describe the changing practices with enough details to illuminate the implications of the emerging recommendation systems. The description of large scale machine learning is mostly based on the authors’ personal encounter with an engineer at Tesco; in many places, the description is vague, and it is difficult to understand what the authors are trying to argue from the examples. I encourage the authors to take a look at the following papers and think about how their work advances this prior work, and how they can better build an argument.

Bucher, T. (2012). Want to be on the top? Algorithmic power and the threat of invisibility on Facebook. new media & society, 14(7), 1164-1180.

Barocas, S., & Selbst, A. D. (2016). Big data's disparate impact.

- In its current form, there is a huge disconnect between the abstract/conclusion and the actual paper content. For example, the abstract says “[...] the constitutive incompleteness of shopping lists, their propensity to expand or change, becomes more important than their capacity to inscribe social order. This suggests that the conversion of lists from finite ordering to indeterminate propensity in recommender systems requires new ways of conceptualizing social order.” I couldn’t find a basis of this argument in the paper. The paper talks about incompleteness, propensity to change. But it does not discuss why it is more important than "their capacity to inscribe social order", or what they mean by "new ways of conceptualizing social order."

- The paper needs a major rewriting. When reading the paper, I couldn’t understand the author’s main argument at all. Many figures do not contribute to the argument, and some are illegible.

# Reviewer 3

The paper argues that recommendation systems such as Tesco’s contrast narratives about the ordering and narrowing tendencies of big data systems, instead producing a tendency for indefinite extension and recombination. This difference is located in the formal technical logic of the recommender system, wherein vast quantities of things (grocery products) must constantly be resolved into meaningful (profitable) recommendations, and wherein those recommendations actualise into practiced reality the potentiality or possibility of correlations in buyer preferences. This is a well written and well organised article. Its specific and detailed analysis of Tesco's predictive system makes an original contribution, and the skilful bridging of that empirical material with Mark Hansen's media theory provides added value of a nuanced and grounded discussion of the formal tendencies and operative principles that we often shorthand 'probability' and 'prediction'. However, the article does suffer in certain areas from a lack of cohesion and clarity in the argumentation; the language it uses sometimes only becomes clear later on, while the default to higher-level conceptual language can end up clouding the analysis. The below queries and suggestions further discuss those issues. On the whole, I recommend the paper for publication with minor revisions.

1. List
The terms in which the introductory section establishes the problem don’t seem to resonate maximally with the content of the analysis. While the broader introduction of groceries and supermarkets re. commodity-geography is valid, the specific identification of the shopping list as an intersectional ordering device seems much more particular to the article's concerns - and resonating immediately with the problems of categorisation, association, correlation, that are central to recommendation systems themselves. One option would be to compress the former and extend the latter, and perhaps make gestures to the historical importance of lists, tables, databases, etc. as ordering devices that always present a double-bind: they allow us to read and organise the multitude facing us, but they also program and normalise our own behaviour and perception. (e.g. Mark Poster's 'Databases as Discourse'; McQuillan's 'Algorithmic states of exception') Another option would be to discuss the openness/closedness difference in understanding big data systems up front, as a way of signalling to the reader the broader stakes of arguing that Tesco’s system shows a ‘propensity to expand or change’ (Abstract). A useful reference in this regard might be Michael Betancourt’s ‘The Demands of Agnotology’, which discusses the meaning-agnostic recombinatory potential of signs in data-hungry systems as the primary engine of their profitability. The place of the formal particularity of the list in the analysis is ambiguous. The opening pages seem to imply this will be central, e.g. the discussion in p6-7, but it seems to disappear after that. What exactly is the role of the list as a specific form or medium in the conversions of probability and propensity? Or is the point that the list’s traditional function as an ordering device becomes rather secondary, insofar as the list of the Tesco system is no longer the same kind of list at all?

2. Tesco
The specific focus on Tesco's system, and using the career history of Clive Humby to refract the wider shifts in big data / advertising / audience research, works well and is told well. The decision to model and approximate Tesco's system from available information is a credible one, but I think readers - both those literate in big data analytics and those that are not - would benefit fromlearning more precisely what is the expected fidelity of this reconstruction and the steps taken (perhaps in footnotes/appendix). What data is available through the Tesco API? Presumably, the actual algorithms for Tesco's recommendation systems are proprietary? And so on. Naturally, a full reconstruction is neither reasonable nor necessary - it's more about informing the reader as to what has been done to achieve what kind of approximation, and what this allows us to analyse as opposed to, say, simply analysing the actual recommender system from the consumer end by going there and using it. (I acknowledge that some of this occurs later in the article, e.g. the discussion of the apriori algorithm in p16; it would suffice to flag all this for the reader in general terms at this stage.)

3. Propensity & Closedness
On one hand, the article is solidly grounded in specific, relevant, non-trivial empirical research, and relates this to appropriate levels of conceptual analysis. On the other, there is sometimes an imbalance in how the writing travels across those levels. E.g. having already been told that the shopping list 'lies at the intersection of these logistical flows' as an 'intersectional ordering device that encapsulates a universe of possible references' (p2), the reader again is informed that lists 'take shape at the intersection of web and internet infrastructures [etc]' (p3), and, shortly after, that the recommendations list 'exemplifies a transformation in forms of ordering' in which it 'reassembles individualised desire, consumption practices, value-chains...' (p5) So there is a consistent and repeated jump between empirical description to (ironically) a listing of generalised concepts - but at this point, I think the reader is well ready for more precise conceptual analysis: not just 'a transformation', but what kind of transformation? Not just a reassembling of desire and consumption practices, but what principles behind this reassembly that privileges what kinds of order? Without this specificity, the conceptual discussion risks becoming too vague for the reader; e.g. we learn that 'recommender systems stage an epistemic-operational transformation central to big data' (p5-6), but what we really want to know is what kind of transformation is happening. This would also help the introduction set out the broader 'so what' stakes of the article, which at the moment is not very explicit.

A similar problem recurs in later sections, where I think part of the issue concerns what gets labelled as a propensity in terms of the argumentative structure, and the precise conceptual distinction between probability and propensity, openness and closedness. E.g. the statement '...in which the propensities of things as commodities and the propensities of people mingle with each other, without overflowing the site of their ordering encounter, the list' (p21) makes sense at a general level, i.e. that the propensity towards a plenitude of possible combinations is constantly negotiated with the perceived benefits of personalisation and individuation. But it is unclear why those are pegged to the propensities of commodities and of people, and the expression of 'overflowing...' seems to overdramatise the relatively dry and pragmatic work of achieving humanly manageable results from big datasets. This isn’t to say the author is ‘wrong’, but that the analysis doesn't achieve the desired level of clarity across the various ingredients it has presented. E.g. Hansen's associative propensity (p22) contrasts the actual totality of possibilities and the reduced field of predictive datasets; footnote 5 hints that the author's view cuts the situation differently, but it isn't quite clear how, in part because it is not yet clarified how 'a model of personhood based on purchase data [can be said to] delimit the propensities of things'. (p22)

Clarifying the above portion of the article is critical because, as we see later, the article's main argument hinges on showing what kinds of openness and closure are exhibited by Tesco'srecommendation system, and how this effects the conversion of probabilities into propensities. In p25-6, the author begins by contrasting Hansen's surplus sensibility to a 'dearth of sensibility' in the case study. But surplus sensibility, in the Whiteheadian sense, wouldn't necessarily be a surplus of meaning, but an excess of data, of materia, of things; the erection of closed boundaries is necessary not because there is too much meaning out there, but because there is so much nonsense. In this light, wouldn't Patel's problem of 'lots of zeros' match precisely Hansen's surplus of sensibility, in that big data systems often struggle to close in on meaningful correlations and data out of the multitude? Following on from that, I would like to know what is the basis for the author to say that 'thinking of good features' actually involves opening up the database to this surplus, and there should be more clarification on how this involves 'probabilities becom[ing] propensities' (p27). Some clarification is found later in p31 ('the propensities of things are enclosed as probabilities ... only to the extent that probabilities themselves become propensities'), but the conceptual and operational sense in which probabilities 'become' propensities, or what this transformation entails, remains implicit rather than explicit.

E.g. there seems to be the argument that recommendation systems, built to have a special interest in identifying profitable probabilities, then play a key role in actualising those probabilities, retraining consumers to *fulfil* those probabilistic behaviours, and thereby breed or at least accentuate their propensities for particular forms of consumption. If this is a reasonable reading of the argument - and especially if it is not - it would be good to have these come out more explicitly.

The conclusion helpfully states that the technical and formal properties driving the management, enclosure, interpretation, of propensities effects the 'negotiation, compromises, rituals and local orderings of everyday life.' (p34) It would be fruitful to have a little more specificity on what kinds of shifts in social order, consumer-data-merchant relations, etc., are being encouraged or piggybacked by these systems; i.e. what the social order is changing into through these systems. (I do accept that there are scope limitations to the article, and that the change here is going to be more nuanced and indirect than in an analysis like Turow's.) Similarly, if the DunnHumby model demonstrates a certain openness to be required and retained in predictive conversion systems, what is the 'so what' element of this observation? Are we to understand the open/closed problem here in the classic binary of determination and freedom, and see this openness as a positive space of alternatives - or, in fact, a useful space for interpretive flexibility that gives these recommendation systems the power to pronounce self-fulfilling prophecies in the form of seemingly objective predictions?

4. Miscellaneous Comments

There is a non-negligible amount of language errors, which should be resolved for final publication; I
have noted some below for the authors' convenience.
p1: should be 'an analysis of Netflix recommendations'
p1-2: should be 'slips and oversights to which every shopper is prone'
p2: should be 'contemporary supermarkets'
p3: should be 'indulgence and health, increasingly, online...'
p5: should be 'There are only a few of them: five. The question is: which five items, and in
what order?'p15: 'If 'Tesco is the clear winner...' sentence has inconsistent tenses
fig.4: should be 'between' not 'betwene'
p20: 'or as I side' meaning unclear
p20: 'proliferate into a Tesco's' meaning unclear
p21: 'warehouse confronts produces' appears to be errata
Other minor queries:
p2: what is a 'commodity-geography'?
p2: The comment on groceries as sacrificial ritual - it isn't clear how this fits into this article
specifically, though of course the broader discussion could be had elsewhere.
p5: is 'conversion' here the supermarket / recommender system's terminology, or the
author's? Valid in either case, but the reader would benefit from knowing.
p6: should it be 'as literary forms, list-making commonly appears in literature'?
p8: at this stage in the article, it is unclear to the reader what 'predictive re-writing of lists'
refers to - the production of new lists through algorithmic prediction? the transformation of
consumer-made lists? the more general shift in the significance of shopping lists through the
entrance of predictive recommendation systems?
p20: what is meant by the statement that 'there is... a logistic propensity in things that
recommender systems encounter'? What kind of propensity can we identify in the Groceries
dataset, beyond the observation that there are extremely large numbers of items and
combinations?
p24-5: The article goes from the discussion of personalisation and personhood via datasets
(p24 top) to how the recommendation system produces and models a certain social order
(p25) - but the connection is not quite clear; more signposting here would aid the reader.
